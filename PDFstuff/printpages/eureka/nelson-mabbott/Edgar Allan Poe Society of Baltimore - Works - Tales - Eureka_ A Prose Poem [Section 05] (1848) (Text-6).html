            <p class="flind4"> I maintain, first, that <i>only</i> in the mode described is it conceivable that Matter could have been diffused so as
              to fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution. I maintain, secondly, that these conditions
              themselves have been imposed upon me, as necessities, in a train of ratiocination <i>as rigorously logical as that which establishes any
                demonstration in Euclid;</i> and I maintain, thirdly, that even if the charge of &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; were as fully sustained as
              it is, in fact, unsustained and untenable, still the validity and indisputability of my result would not, even in the slightest
              particular, be disturbed. <a name="pg0064">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;64:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To explain: &mdash; The Newtonian Gravity &mdash; a law of Nature &mdash; a law whose existence as such no one out of
              Bedlam questions &mdash; a law whose admission as such enables us to account for nine-tenths of the Universal ph&aelig;nomena &mdash; a
              law which, merely because it does so enable us to account for these ph&aelig;nomena, we are perfectly willing, without reference to any
              other considerations, to admit, and cannot help admitting, as a law &mdash; a law, nevertheless, of which neither the principle nor the
                <i>modus operandi</i> of the principle, has ever yet been traced by the human analysis &mdash; a law, in short, which, neither in its
              detail nor in its generality, has been found susceptible of explanation <i>at all</i> &mdash; is at length seen to be at every point
              thoroughly explicable, provided we only yield our assent to &mdash;&mdash; what? To an hypothesis? Why <i>if</i> an hypothesis &mdash;
              if the merest hypothesis &mdash; if an hypothesis for whose assumption &mdash; as in the case of that <i>pure</i> hypothesis the
              Newtonian law itself &mdash; no shadow of <i>&agrave; priori</i> reason could be assigned &mdash; if an hypothesis, even so absolute as
              all this implies, would enable us to perceive a principle for the Newtonian law &mdash; would enable us to understand as satisfied,
              conditions so miraculously &mdash; so ineffably complex and seemingly irreconcileable as those involved in the relations of which
              Gravity tells us, &mdash; what rational being <i>could</i> so expose his fatuity as to call even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis
              any longer &mdash; unless, indeed, he were to persist in so calling it, with the understanding that he did so, simply for the sake of
              consistency <i>in words?</i>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But what is the true state of our present case? What is <i>the fact?</i> Not only that it is <i>not</i> an hypothesis
              which <a name="pg0065">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;65:]</span> we are required <i>to adopt</i>, in order to admit the
              principle at issue explained, but that it <i>is</i> a logical conclusion which we are requested <i>not</i> to adopt if we can avoid it
              &mdash; which we are simply invited to <i>deny if we can:</i> &mdash; a conclusion of so accurate a logicality that to dispute it would
              be the effort &mdash; to doubt its validity beyond our power: &mdash; a conclusion from which we see no mode of escape, turn as we will;
              a result which confronts us either at the end of an <i>in</i>ductive journey from the ph&aelig;nomena of the very Law discussed, or at
              the close of a <i>de</i>ductive career from the most rigorously simple of all conceivable assumptions &mdash; <i>the assumption, in a
                word, of Simplicity itself</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> And if here, for the mere sake of cavilling, it be urged, that although my starting-point is, as I assert, the
              assumption of absolute Simplicity, yet Simplicity, considered merely in itself, is no axiom; and that only deductions from axioms are
              indisputable &mdash; it is thus that I reply: &mdash; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Every other science than Logic is the science of certain concrete relations. Arithmetic, for example, is the science of
              the relations of number &mdash; Geometry, of the relations of form &mdash; Mathematics in general, of the relations of quantity in
              general &mdash; of whatever can be increased or diminished. Logic, however, is the science of Relation in the abstract &mdash; of
              absolute Relation &mdash; of Relation considered solely in itself. An axiom in any particular science other than Logic is, thus, merely
              a proposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too obvious for dispute &mdash; as when we say, for instance, that
              the whole is greater than its part: &mdash; and, thus again, the principle of the <i>Logical</i> axiom &mdash; in other words, of an
              axiom in the abstract &mdash; is, <a name="pg0066">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;66:]</span> simply, <i>obviousness of
                relation</i>. Now, it is clear, not only that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious to another, but that what is obvious to
              one mind at one epoch, may be anything but obvious, at another epoch, to the same mind. It is clear, moreover, that what, to-day, is
              obvious even to the majority of mankind, or to the majority of the best intellects of mankind, may to-morrow be, to either majority,
              more or less obvious, or in no respect obvious at all. It is seen, then, that the <i>axiomatic principle</i> itself is susceptible of
              variation, and of course that axioms are susceptible of similar change. Being mutable, the &ldquo;truths&rdquo; which grow out of them
              are necessarily mutable too; or, in other words, are never to be positively depended upon as truths at all &mdash; since Truth and
              Immutability are one. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It will now be readily understood that no axiomatic idea &mdash; no idea founded in the fluctuating principle,
              obviousness of relation &mdash; can possibly be so secure &mdash; so reliable a basis for any structure erected by the Reason, as
                <i>that</i> idea &mdash; (whatever it is, wherever we can find it, or <i>if</i> it be practicable to find it anywhere) &mdash; which
              is <i>ir</i>relative altogether &mdash; which not only presents to the understanding <i>no obviousness</i> of relation, either greater
              or less, to be considered, but subjects the intellect, not in the slightest degree, to the necessity of even looking at <i>any relation
                at all</i>. If such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term &ldquo;an axiom,&rdquo; it is at least preferable, as a Logical basis,
              to any axiom ever propounded, or to all imaginable axioms combined: &mdash; and such, precisely, is the idea with which my deductive
              process, so thoroughly corroborated by induction, commences. My <i>particle proper</i> is but <i>absolute Irrelation</i>. To sum up <a
                name="pg0067">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;67:]</span> what has been here advanced: &mdash; As a starting point I have
              taken it for granted, simply, that the Beginning had nothing behind it or before it &mdash; that it was a Beginning in fact &mdash; that
              it was a Beginning and nothing different from a Beginning &mdash; in short that this Beginning was &mdash;&mdash; <i>that which it
                was</i>. If this be a &ldquo;mere assumption,&rdquo; then a &ldquo;mere assumption&rdquo; let it be. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To conclude this branch of the subject: &mdash; I am fully warranted in announcing that <i>the Law which we have been
                in the habit of calling Gravity exists on account of Matter&rsquo;s having been radiated, at its origin, atomically, into a
                limited</i><a name="tf06701" href="#fn06701">*</a>
              <i>sphere of Space, from one, individual, unconditional, irrelative, and absolute Particle Proper, by the sole process in which it was
                possible to satisfy, at the same time, the two conditions, radiation, and generally-equable distribution throughout the sphere &mdash;
                that is to say, by a force varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances between the radiated atoms, respectively,
                and the Particular centre of Radiation</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I have already given my reasons for presuming Matter to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous
              or infinitely continued force. Supposing a continuous force, we should be unable, in the first place, to comprehend a r&euml;action at
              all; and we should be required, in the second place, to entertain the impossible conception of an infinite extension of Matter. Not to
              dwell upon the impossibility of the conception, the infinite extension of Matter is an idea which, if not positively disproved, <a
                name="pg0068">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;68:]</span> is at least not in any respect warranted by telescopic observation
              of the stars &mdash; a point to be explained more fully hereafter; and this empirical reason for believing in the original finity of
              Matter is unempirically confirmed. For example: &mdash; Admitting, for the moment, the possibility of understanding Space [[as]]
                <i>filled</i> with the radiated atoms &mdash; that is to say, admitting, as well as we can, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that the
              succession of the radiated atoms had absolutely <i>no end</i> &mdash; then it is abundantly clear that, even when the Volition of God
              had been withdrawn from them, and thus the tendency to return into Unity permitted (abstractly) to be satisfied, this permission would
              have been nugatory and invalid &mdash; practically valueless and of no effect whatever. No R&euml;action could have taken place; no
              movement toward Unity could have been made; no Law of Gravity could have obtained. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To explain: &mdash; Grant the <i>abstract</i> tendency of any one atom to any one other as the inevitable result of
              diffusion from the normal Unity: &mdash; or, what is the same thing, admit any given atom as <i>proposing</i> to move in any given
              direction &mdash; it is clear that, since there is an <i>infinity</i> of atoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move, it never can
              actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given, on account of a precisely equal and counter-balancing
              tendency in the direction diametrically opposite. In other words, exactly as many tendencies to Unity are behind the hesitating atom as
              before it; for it is a mere sotticism to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter than another infinite line, or that one
              infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite. Thus <a name="pg0069">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;69:]</span> the atom in question must remain stationary forever. Under the impossible circumstances which we have been
              merely endeavoring to conceive for argument&rsquo;s sake, there could have been no aggregation of Matter &mdash; no stars &mdash; no
              worlds &mdash; nothing but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential Universe. In fact, view it as we will, the whole idea of unlimited
              Matter is not only untenable, but impossible and preposterous. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> With the understanding of a <i>sphere</i> of atoms, however, we perceive, at once, a <i>satisfiable</i> tendency to
              union. The general result of the tendency each to each, being a tendency of all to the centre, the <i>general</i> process of
              condensation, or approximation, commences immediately, by a common and simultaneous movement, on withdrawal of the Divine Volition; the
                <i>individual</i> approximations, or coalescences &mdash; <i>not</i> c&ouml;alitions &mdash; of atom with atom, being subject to
              almost infinite variations of time, degree, and condition, on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation, arising from the
              differences of form assumed as characterizing the atoms at the moment of their quitting the Particle Proper; as well as from the
              subsequent particular inequidistance, each from each. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> What I wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there arising, at once, (on withdrawal of the diffusive
              force, or Divine Volition,) out of the condition of the atoms as described, at innumerable points throughout the Universal sphere,
              innumerable agglomerations, characterized by innumerable specific differences of form, size, essential nature, and distance each from
              each. The development of Repulsion (Electricity) must have commenced, of course, <a name="pg0070">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;70:]</span> with the very earliest particular efforts at Unity, and must have proceeded constantly in the ratio of
              Coalescence &mdash; that is to say, <i>in that of Condensation</i>, or, again, of Heterogeneity. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Thus the two Principles Proper, <i>Attraction</i> and <i>Repulsion</i> &mdash; the Material and the Spiritual &mdash;
              accompany each other, in the strictest fellowship, forever. Thus <i>The Body and The Soul walk hand in hand</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> If now, in fancy, we select <i>any one</i> of the agglomerations considered as in their primary stages throughout the
              Universal sphere, and suppose this incipient agglomeration to be taking place at that point where the centre of our Sun exists &mdash;
              or rather where it <i>did</i> exist originally; for the Sun is perpetually shifting his position &mdash; we shall find ourselves met,
              and borne onward for a time at least, by the most magnificent of theories &mdash; by the Nebular Cosmogony of Laplace: &mdash; although
              &ldquo;Cosmogony&rdquo; is far too comprehensive a term for what he really discusses &mdash; which is the constitution of our solar
              system alone &mdash; of one among the myriad of similar systems which make up the Universe Proper &mdash; that Universal sphere &mdash;
              that all-inclusive and absolute <i>Kosmos</i> which forms the subject of my present Discourse. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Confining himself to an <i>obviously limited</i> region &mdash; that of our solar system with its comparatively
              immediate vicinity &mdash; and <i>merely</i> assuming &mdash; that is to say, assuming without any basis whatever, either deductive or
              inductive &mdash; <i>much</i> of what I have been just endeavoring to place upon a more stable basis than assumption; assuming, for
              example, matter as diffused (without pretending to account for the diffusion) throughout, and somewhat beyond, the space <a
                name="pg0071">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;71:]</span> occupied by our system &mdash; diffused in a state of heterogeneous
              nebulosity and obedient to that omniprevalent law of Gravity at whose principle he ventured to make no guess; &mdash; assuming all this
              (which is quite true, although he had no logical right to its assumption) Laplace has shown, dynamically and mathematically, that the
              results in such case necessarily ensuing, are those and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing condition of the
              system itself. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To explain: &mdash; Let us conceive <i>that</i> particular agglomeration of which we have just spoken &mdash; the one
              at the point designated by our Sun&rsquo;s centre &mdash; to have so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here
              assumed a roughly globular form; its centre being, of course, coincident with what is now, or rather was originally, the centre of our
              Sun; and its periphery extending out beyond the orbit of Neptune, the most remote of our planets: &mdash; in other words, let us suppose
              the diameter of this rough sphere to be some 6000 millions of miles. For ages, this mass of matter has been undergoing condensation,
              until at length it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine; having proceeded gradually, of course, from its atomic and imperceptible
              state, into what we understand of visible, palpable, or otherwise appreciable nebulosity. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary axis &mdash; a rotation which, commencing with
              the absolute incipiency of the aggregation, has been ever since acquiring velocity. The very first two atoms which met, approaching each
              other from points not diametrically opposite, would, in rushing partially past each other, form a <a name="pg0072">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;72:]</span> nucleus for the rotary movement described. How this would increase in velocity, is readily seen.
              The two atoms are joined by others: &mdash; an aggregation is formed. The mass continues to rotate while condensing. But any atom at the
              circumference has, of course, a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre. The outer atom, however, with its superior velocity,
              approaches the centre; carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes. Thus every atom, proceeding inwardly, and finally attaching
              itself to the condensed centre, adds something to the original velocity of that centre &mdash; that is to say, increases the rotary
              movement of the mass. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies <i>precisely</i> the space circumscribed by the orbit of
              Neptune, and that the velocity with which the surface of the mass moves, in the general rotation, is precisely that velocity with which
              Neptune now revolves about the Sun. At this epoch, then, we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force, having
              gotten the better of the non-increasing centripetal, loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum, or a few of the
              exterior and least condensed strata, at the equator of the sphere, where the tangential velocity predominated; so that these strata
              formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regions: &mdash; just as the exterior portion thrown off, by
              excessive velocity of rotation, from a grindstone, would form a ring about the grindstone, but for the solidity of the superficial
              material: were this caoutchouc, or anything similar in consistency, precisely the ph&aelig;nomenon I describe would be presented. <a
                name="pg0073">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;73:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass, <i>revolved</i>, of course, <i>as</i> a separate ring, with just that
              velocity with which, while the surface of the mass, it <i>rotated</i>. In the meantime, condensation still proceeding, the interval
              between the discharged ring and the main body continued to increase, until the former was left at a vast distance from the latter. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, admitting the ring to have possessed, by some seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials, a
              constitution nearly uniform, then this ring, <i>as</i> such, would never have ceased revolving about its primary; but, as might have
              been anticipated, there appears to have been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials, to make them cluster about centres
              of superior solidity; and thus the annular form was destroyed.<a name="tf07301" href="#fn07301">*</a> No doubt, the band was soon broken
              up into several portions, and one of these portions, predominating in mass, absorbed the others into itself; the whole settling,
              spherically, into a planet. That this latter, <i>as</i> a planet, continued the revolutionary movement which characterized it while a
              ring, is sufficiently clear; and that it took upon itself, also, an additional movement in its new condition of sphere, is readily
              explained. The ring being understood as yet unbroken, we see that its exterior, while the whole revolves about the parent body, moves
              more rapidly than its interior. When the rupture occurred, then, some <a name="pg0074">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;74:]</span> portion in each fragment must have been moving with greater velocity than the others. The superior movement
              prevailing, must have whirled each fragment round &mdash; that is to say, have caused it to rotate; and the direction of the rotation
              must, of course, have been the direction of the revolution whence it arose. <i>All</i> the fragments having become subject to the
              rotation described, must, in coalescing, have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their coalescence. &mdash; This planet was
              Neptune. Its material continuing to undergo condensation, and the centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting, at length, the
              better of the centripetal, as before in the case of the parent orb, a ring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet;
              this ring, having been ununiform in its constitution, was broken up, and its several fragments, being absorbed by the most massive, were
              collectively spherified into a moon. Subsequently, the operation was repeated, and a second moon was the result. We thus account for the
              planet Neptune, with the two satellites which accompany him.<a name="tf07401" href="#fn07401">*</a>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In throwing of a ring from its equator, the Sun re-established that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal
              forces which had been disturbed in the process of condensation; but, as this condensation still proceeded, the equilibrium was again
              immediately disturbed, through the increase of rotation. By the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just
              that circumscribed by the orbit of Uranus, we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new
              relief was needed: a second equatorial band was, consequently, thrown off, which, proving ununiform, was <a name="pg0075">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;75:]</span> broken up, as before in the case of Neptune; the fragments settling into the planet Uranus; the
              velocity of whose actual revolution about the Sun indicates, of course, the rotary speed of that Sun&rsquo;s equatorial surface at the
              moment of the separation. Uranus, adopting a rotation from the collective rotations of the fragments composing it, as previously
              explained, now threw off ring after ring; each of which, becoming broken up, settled into a moon: &mdash; three moons, at different
              epochs, having been formed, in this manner, by the rupture and general spherification of as many distinct ununiform rings. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> By the time the Sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of Saturn, the balance,
              we are to suppose, between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed, through increase of rotary
              velocity, the result of condensation, that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary; and an annular band was therefore whirled
              off, as twice before; which, on rupture through ununiformity, became consolidated into the planet Saturn. This latter threw off, in the
              first place, seven ununiform bands, which, on rupture, were spherified respectively into as many moons; but, subsequently, it appears to
              have discharged, at three distinct but not very distant epochs, three rings whose equability of constitution was, by apparent accident,
              so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture; thus they continue to revolve as rings. I use the phrase
                &ldquo;<i>apparent</i> accident;&rdquo; for of accident in the ordinary sense there was, of course, nothing: &mdash; the term is
              properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable <i>law</i>. <a name="pg0076">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;76:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Shrinking still farther, until it occupied just the space circumscribed by the orbit of Jupiter, the Sun now found need
              of farther effort to restore the counterbalance of its two forces, continually disarranged in the still continued increase of rotation.
              Jupiter, accordingly, was now thrown off; passing from the annular to the planetary condition; and, on attaining this latter, threw off
              in its turn, at four different epochs, four rings, which finally resolved themselves into so many moons. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Still shrinking, until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the orbit of the Asteroids, the Sun now discarded
              a ring which appears to have had <i>nine</i> centres of superior solidity, and, on breaking up, to have separated into nine fragments no
              one of which so far predominated in mass as to absorb the others.<a name="tf07601" href="#fn07601">*</a> All therefore, as distinct
              although comparatively small planets, proceeded to revolve in orbits whose distances, each from each, may be considered as in some
              degree the measure of the force which drove them asunder: &mdash; all the orbits, nevertheless, being so closely coincident as to admit
              of our calling them <i>one</i>, in view of the other planetary orbits. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Continuing to shrink, the Sun, on becoming so small as just to fill the orbit of Mars, now discharged this planet
              &mdash; of course by the process repeatedly described. Having no moon, however, Mars could have thrown off no ring. In fact, an epoch
              had now arrived in the career of the parent body, the centre of the system. The <i>de</i>crease of its nebulosity, which is the
                <i>in</i>crease of its density, and which again is the <i>de</i>crease of its condensation, out of which latter arose the constant
              disturbance of equilibrium &mdash; must, by this period, <a name="pg0077">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;77:]</span> have
              attained a point at which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more ineffectual just in proportion as they were less
              frequently needed. Thus the processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs of exhaustion &mdash; in the planets,
              first, and secondly, in the original mass. We must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among the
              planets as we approach the Sun, to be in any respect indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were discarded.
              Exactly the converse is to be understood. The longest interval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two interior;
              the shortest, between those of the two exterior, planets. The decrease of the interval of space is, nevertheless, the measure of the
              density, and thus inversely of the condensation, of the Sun, throughout the processes detailed. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Having shrunk, however, so far as to fill only the orbit of our Earth, the parent sphere whirled from itself still one
              other body &mdash; the Earth &mdash; in a condition so nebulous as to admit of this body&rsquo;s discarding, in its turn, yet another,
              which is our Moon; &mdash; but here terminated the lunar formations. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Finally, subsiding to the orbits first of Venus and then of Mercury, the Sun discarded these two interior planets;
              neither of which has given birth to any moon. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Thus from his original bulk &mdash; or, to speak more accurately, from the condition in which we first considered him
              &mdash; from a partially spherified nebular mass, <i>certainly</i> much more than 5,600 millions of miles in diameter &mdash; the great
              central orb and origin of our solar-planetary-lunar system, <a name="pg0078">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;78:]</span> has
              gradually descended, by condensation, in obedience to the law of Gravity, to a globe only 882,000 miles in diameter; but it by no means
              follows, either that its condensation is yet complete, or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another
              planet. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I have here given &mdash; in outline, of course, but still with all the detail necessary for distinctness &mdash; a
              view of the Nebular Theory as its author himself conceived it. From whatever point we regard it, we shall find it <i>beautifully
                true</i>. It is by far too beautiful, indeed, <i>not</i> to possess Truth as its essentiality &mdash; and here I am very profoundly
              serious in what I say. In the revolution of the satellites of Uranus, there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with the
              assumptions of Laplace; but that <i>one</i> inconsistency can invalidate a theory constructed from a million of intricate consistencies,
              is a fancy fit only for the fantastic. In prophesying, confidently, that the apparent anomaly to which I refer, will, sooner or later,
              be found one of the strongest possible corroborations of the general hypothesis, I pretend to no especial spirit of divination. It is a
              matter which the only difficulty seems <i>not</i> to foresee.<a name="tf07801" href="#fn07801">*</a>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The bodies whirled off in the processes described, would exchange, it has been seen, the superficial <i>rotation</i> of
              the orbs whence they originated, for a <i>revolution</i> of equal velocity about these orbs as distant centres; and the revolution thus
              engendered must proceed, so long as the centripetal force, or that with which the discarded body gravitates toward <a name="pg0079"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;79:]</span> its parent, is neither greater nor less than that by which it was discarded; that
              is, than the centrifugal, or, far more properly, than the tangential, velocity. From the unity, however, of the origin of these two
              forces, we might have expected to find them as they are found &mdash; the one accurately counterbalancing the other. It has been shown,
              indeed, that the act of whirling-off is, in every case, merely an act for the preservation of the counterbalance. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> After referring, however, the centripetal force to the omniprevalent law of Gravity, it has been the fashion with
              astronomical treatises, to seek beyond the limits of mere Nature &mdash; that is to say, of <i>Secondary</i> Cause &mdash; a solution of
              the ph&aelig;nomenon of tangential velocity. This latter they attribute directly to a <i>First</i> Cause &mdash; to God. The force which
              carries a stellar body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the finger &mdash; this is
              the childish phraseology employed &mdash; by the finger of Deity itself. In this view, the planets, fully formed, are conceived to have
              been hurled from the Divine hand, to a position in the vicinity of the suns, with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses, or
              attractive capacities, of the suns themselves. An idea so grossly unphilosophical, although so supinely adopted, could have arisen only
              from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation, each to each, of two forces so seemingly
              independent, one of the other, as are the gravitating and tangential. But it should be remembered that, for a long time, the coincidence
              between the moon&rsquo;s rotation and her sidereal revolution &mdash; two matters seemingly far more independent than those now
              considered &mdash; was <a name="pg0080">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;80:]</span> looked upon as positively miraculous; and
              there was a strong disposition, even among astronomers, to attribute the marvel to the direct and continual agency of God &mdash; who,
              in this case, it was said, had found it necessary to interpose, specially, among his general laws, a set of subsidiary regulations, for
              the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories, or perhaps the horrors, of the other side of the Moon &mdash; of that
              mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided, and must perpetually avoid, the telescopic scrutiny of mankind. The advance of Science,
              however, soon demonstrated &mdash; what to the philosophical instinct needed <i>no</i> demonstration &mdash; that the one movement is
              but a portion &mdash; something more, even, than a consequence &mdash; of the other. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> For my part, I have no patience with fantasies at once so timorous, so idle, and so awkward. They belong to the veriest
                <i>cowardice</i> of thought. That Nature and the God of Nature are distinct, no thinking being can long doubt. By the former we imply
              merely the laws of the latter. But with the very idea of God, omnipotent, omniscient, we entertain, also, the idea of <i>the
                infallibility</i> of his laws. With Him there being neither Past nor Future &mdash; with Him all being <i>Now</i> &mdash; do we not
              insult him in supposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible contingency? &mdash; or, rather, what idea <i>can</i>
              we have of <i>any</i> possible contingency, except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of his laws? He who, divesting
              himself of prejudice, shall have the rare courage to think absolutely for himself, cannot fail to arrive, in the end, at the
              condensation of <i>laws</i> into <i>Law</i> &mdash; cannot fail of reaching the conclusion <a name="pg0081">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;81:]</span> that <i>each law of Nature is dependent at all points upon all other laws</i>, and that all are but
              consequences of one primary exercise of the Divine Volition. Such is the principle of the Cosmogony which, with all necessary deference,
              I here venture to suggest and to maintain. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In this view, it will be seen that, dismissing as frivolous, and even impious, the fancy of the tangential force having
              been imparted to the planets immediately by &ldquo;the finger of God,&rdquo; I consider this force as originating in the rotation of the
              stars: &mdash; this rotation as brought about by the in-rushing of the primary atoms, towards their respective centres of aggregation:
              &mdash; this in-rushing as the consequence of the law of Gravity: &mdash; this law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested
              the tendency of the atoms to return into imparticularity: &mdash; this tendency to return as but the inevitable r&euml;action of the
              first and most sublime of Acts &mdash; that act by which a God, self-existing and alone existing, became all things at once, through
              dint of his volition, while all things were thus constituted a portion of God. </p>
