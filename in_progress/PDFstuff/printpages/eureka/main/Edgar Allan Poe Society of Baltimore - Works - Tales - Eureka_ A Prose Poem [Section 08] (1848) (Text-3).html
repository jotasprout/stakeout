            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In the first place, we may get a general, <i>relative</i> conception of the interval referred to, by comparing it with
              the inter-planetary spaces. If, for example, we suppose the Earth, which is, in reality, 95 millions of miles from the Sun, to be only
                <i>one foot</i> from that luminary; then Neptune would be 40 feet distant; <i>and the star Alpha Lyr&aelig;, at the very least</i>,
              159. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now I presume that, in the termination of my last sentence, few of my readers have noticed anything especially
              objectionable &mdash; particularly wrong. I said that the distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at <i>one foot</i>, the
              distance of Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyr&aelig;, 159. The proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared, perhaps,
              to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two intervals &mdash; that of the Earth from the Sun and that
              of Alpha Lyr&aelig; from the same luminary. But my account of the matter should, in reality, <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0113"
                  >[page&nbsp;113:]</a></span> have run thus: &mdash; The distance of the Earth from the Sun being taken at one foot, the distance of
              Neptune would be 40 feet, and that of Alpha Lyr&aelig;, 159 &mdash;&mdash; <i>miles:</i> &mdash; that is to say, I had assigned to Alpha
              Lyr&aelig;, in my first statement of the case, only the 5280<i>th part</i> of that distance which is the <i>least distance possible</i>
              at which it can actually lie. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To proceed: &mdash; However distant a mere <i>planet</i> is, yet when we look at it through a telescope, we see it
              under a certain form &mdash; of a certain appreciable size. Now I have already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars;
              nevertheless, when we view any one of them, even through the most powerful telescope, it is found to present us with <i>no form</i>, and
              consequently with <i>no magnitude</i> whatever. We see it as a point and nothing more. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Again; &mdash; Let us suppose ourselves walking, at night, on a highway. In a field on one side of the road, is a line
              of tall objects, say trees, the figures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the sky. This line of objects extends
              at right angles to the road, and from the road to the horizon. Now, as we proceed along the road, we see these objects changing their
              positions, respectively, in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background of the view.
              Let us suppose this fixed point &mdash; sufficiently fixed for our purpose &mdash; to be the rising moon. We become aware, at once, that
              while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon, as to seem flying behind us, the tree in the extreme
              distance has scarcely changed at all its relative position with the satellite. We then go on to perceive that the farther the objects
              are from us, the less they alter <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0114">[page&nbsp;114:]</a></span> their positions; and the converse.
              Then we begin, unwittingly, to estimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they evince the relative alteration.
              Finally, we come to understand how it might be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line, by using the
              amount of relative alteration as a basis in a simple geometrical problem. Now this relative alteration is what we call
              &ldquo;parallax;&rdquo; and by parallax we calculate the distances of the heavenly bodies. Applying the principle to the trees in
              question, we should, of course, be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of <i>that</i> tree, which, however far we proceeded
              along the road, should evince <i>no</i> parallax at all. This, in the case described, is a thing impossible; but impossible only because
              all distances on our Earth are trivial indeed: &mdash; in comparison with the vast cosmical quantities, we may speak of them as
              absolutely nothing. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, let us suppose the star Alpha Lyr&aelig; directly overhead; and let us imagine that, instead of standing on the
              Earth, we stand at one end of a straight road stretching through Space to a distance equalling the diameter of the Earth&rsquo;s orbit
              &mdash; that is to say, to a distance of 190 <i>millions of miles</i>. Having observed, by means of the most delicate micrometrical
              instruments, the exact position of the star, let us now pass along this inconceivable road, until we reach its other extremity. Now,
              once again, let us look at the star. It is <i>precisely</i> where we left it. Our instruments, however delicate, assure us that its
              relative position is absolutely &mdash; is identically the same as at the commencement of our unutterable journey. <i>No</i> parallax
              &mdash; none whatever &mdash; has been found. <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0115">[page&nbsp;115:]</a></span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The fact is, that, in regard to the distance of the fixed stars &mdash; of any one of the myriads of suns glistening on
              the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it belongs &mdash;
              astronomical science, until very lately, could speak only with a negative certainty. Assuming the brightest as the nearest, we could
              say, even of <i>them</i>, only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the <i>hither</i> side of which they cannot be:
              &mdash; how far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain. We perceived, for example, that Alpha Lyr&aelig; cannot be
              nearer to us than 19 trillions, 200 billions of miles; but, for all we knew, and indeed for all we now know, it may be distant from us
              the square, or the cube, or any other power of the number mentioned. By dint, however, of wonderfully minute and cautious observations,
              continued, with novel instruments, for many laborious years, <i>Bessel</i>, not long ago deceased, has lately succeeded in determining
              the distance of six or seven stars; among others, that of the star numbered 61 in the constellation of the Swan. The distance in this
              latter instance ascertained, is 670,000 times that of the Sun; which last it will be remembered, is 95 millions of miles. The star 61
              Cygni, then, is nearly 64 trillions of miles from us &mdash; or more than three times the distance assigned, <i>as the least
                possible</i>, for Alpha Lyr&aelig;. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any considerations of <i>velocity</i>, as we did in endeavoring
              to estimate the distance of the moon, we must leave out of sight, altogether, such nothings as the speed of a cannon ball, or of sound.
              Light, however, according to the latest <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0116">[page&nbsp;116:]</a></span> calculations of Struve,
              proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles in a second. Thought itself cannot pass through this interval more speedily &mdash; if, indeed,
              thought can traverse it at all. Yet, in coming from 61 Cygni to us, even at this inconceivable rate, light occupies more than <i>ten
                years;</i> and, consequently, were the star this moment blotted out from the Universe, still, <i>for ten years</i>, would it continue
              to sparkle on, undimmed in its paradoxical glory. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Keeping now in mind whatever feeble conception we may have attained of the interval between our Sun and 61 Cygni, let
              us remember that this interval, however unutterably vast, we are permitted to consider as but the <i>average</i> interval among the
              countless host of stars composing that cluster, or &ldquo;nebula,&rdquo; to which our system, as well as that of 61 Cygni, belongs. I
              have, in fact, stated the case with great moderation: &mdash; we have excellent reason for believing 61 Cygni to be one of the
                <i>nearest</i> stars, and thus for concluding, at least for the present, that its distance from us is <i>less</i> than the average
              distance between star and star in the magnificent cluster of the Milky Way. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> And here, once again and finally, it seems proper to suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles. Ceasing
              to wonder at the space between star and star in our own or in any particular cluster, let us rather turn our thoughts to the intervals
              between cluster and cluster, in the all comprehensive cluster of the Universe. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I have already said that light proceeds at the rate of 167,000 miles in a second &mdash; that is, about 10 millions of
              miles in a minute, or about 600 millions of miles in an hour: &mdash; yet so far removed from us are some of the <span class="pgloc"><a
                  name="pg0117">[page&nbsp;117:]</a></span> &ldquo;nebul&aelig;&rdquo; that even light, speeding with this velocity, could not and
              does not reach us, from those mysterious regions, in less than 3 <i>millions of years</i>. This calculation, moreover, is made by the
              elder Herschell [[Herschel]], and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within the scope of his own telescope.
              There <i>are</i> &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; however, which, through the magical tube of Lord Rosse, are this instant whispering in our
              ears the secrets of <i>a million of ages</i> by-gone. In a word, the events which we behold now &mdash; at this moment &mdash; in those
              worlds &mdash; are the identical events which interested their inhabitants <i>ten hundred thousand centuries ago</i>. In intervals
              &mdash; in distances such as this suggestion forces upon the <i>soul</i> &mdash; rather than upon the mind &mdash; we find, at length, a
              fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of <i>quantity</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Our fancies thus occupied with the cosmical distances, let us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which
              we have so often experienced, while pursuing <i>the beaten path</i> of astronomical reflection, <i>in accounting</i> for the
              immeasurable voids alluded to &mdash; in comprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless, have been
              made to intervene between star and star &mdash; between cluster and cluster &mdash; in understanding, to be brief, a sufficient reason
              for the Titanic scale, in respect of mere <i>Space</i>, on which the Universe is seen to be constructed. A rational cause for the
              ph&aelig;nomenon, I maintain that Astronomy has palpably failed to assign: &mdash; but the considerations through which, in this Essay,
              we have proceeded step by step, enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that <i>Space and Duration are one</i>. That the Universe
              might <i>endure</i> throughout <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0118">[page&nbsp;118:]</a></span> an &aelig;ra at all commensurate with
              the grandeur of its component material portions and with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes, it was necessary that the original
              atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be only not infinite. It was required, in a word, that the stars should be
              gathered into visibility from invisible nebulosity &mdash; proceed from nebulosity to consolidation &mdash; and so grow grey in giving
              birth and death to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of vitalic development: &mdash; it was required that the stars should do
              all this &mdash; should have time thoroughly to accomplish all these Divine purposes &mdash; <i>during the period</i> in which all
              things were effecting their return into Unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances at
              which lay the inevitable End. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute accuracy of the Divine <i>adaptation</i>. The
              density of the stars, respectively, proceeds, of course, as their condensation diminishes; condensation and heterogeneity keep pace with
              each other; through the latter, which is the index of the former, we estimate the vitalic and spiritual development. Thus, in the
              density of the globes, we have the measure in which their purposes are fulfilled. <i>As</i> density proceeds &mdash; <i>as</i> the
              divine intentions <i>are</i> accomplished &mdash; <i>as</i> less and still less remains <i>to be</i> accomplished &mdash; so &mdash; in
              the same ratio &mdash; should we expect to find an acceleration of <i>the End:</i> &mdash; and thus the philosophical mind will easily
              comprehend that the Divine designs in constituting the stars, advance <i>mathematically</i> to their fulfilment: &mdash; and more; it
              will readily give the advance a <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0119">[page&nbsp;119:]</a></span> mathematical expression; it will decide
              that this advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of all created things from the starting-point and goal of
              their creation. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Not only is this Divine adaptation, however, mathematically accurate, but there is that about it which stamps it <i>as
                divine</i>, in distinction from that which is merely the work of human constructiveness. I allude to the complete <i>mutuality</i> of
              adaptation. For example; in human constructions a particular cause has a particular effect; a particular intention brings to pass a
              particular object; but this is all; we see no reciprocity. The effect does not re-act upon the cause; the intention does not change
              relations with the object. In Divine constructions the object is either design or object as we choose to regard it &mdash; and we may
              take at any time a cause for an effect, or the converse &mdash; so that we can never absolutely decide which is which. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To give an instance: &mdash; In polar climates the human frame, to maintain its animal heat, requires, for combustion
              in the capillary system, an abundant supply of highly azotized food, such as train-oil. But again: &mdash; in polar climates nearly the
              sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant seals and whales. Now, whether is oil at hand because imperatively demanded, or the only
              thing demanded because the only thing to be obtained? It is impossible to decide. There is an absolute <i>reciprocity of adaptation</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in the ratio of <i>the approach</i> to this species
              of reciprocity. In the construction of <i>plot</i>, for example, <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0120">[page&nbsp;120:]</a></span> in
              fictitious literature, we should aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to determine, of any one of them, whether
              it depends from any one other or upholds it. In this sense, of course, <i>perfection</i> of <i>plot</i> is really, or practically,
              unattainable &mdash; but only because it is a finite intelligence that constructs. The plots of God are perfect. The Universe is a plot
              of God. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> And now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced, again, to struggle against its propensity for
              analogical inference &mdash; against its monomaniac grasping at the infinite. Moons have been seen <i>revolving</i> about planets;
              planets about stars; and the poetical instinct of humanity &mdash; its instinct of the symmetrical, if the symmetry be but a symmetry of
              surface: &mdash; this <i>instinct</i>, which the Soul, not only of Man but of all created beings, took up, in the beginning, from the
                <i>geometrical</i> basis of the Universal irradiation &mdash; impels us to the fancy of an endless extension of this system of
                <i>cycles</i>. Closing our eyes equally to <i>de</i>duction and <i>in</i>duction, we insist upon imagining a <i>revolution</i> of all
              the orbs of the Galaxy about some gigantic globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole. Each cluster in the great cluster
              of clusters is imagined, of course, to be similarly supplied and constructed; while, that the &ldquo;analogy&rdquo; may be wanting at no
              point, we go on to conceive these clusters themselves, again, as <i>revolving</i> about some still more august sphere; &mdash; this
              latter, still again, <i>with</i> its encircling clusters, as but one of a yet more magnificent series of agglomerations, <i>gyrating</i>
              about yet another orb central <i>to them</i> &mdash; some orb still more unspeakably sublime &mdash; some orb, let us rather say, of
              infinite sublimity <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0121">[page&nbsp;121:]</a></span> endlessly multiplied by the infinitely sublime. Such
              are the conditions, continued in perpetuity, which the voice of what some people term &ldquo;analogy&rdquo; calls upon the Fancy to
              depict and the Reason to contemplate, if possible, without becoming dissatisfied with the picture. Such, <i>in general</i>, are the
              interminable gyrations beyond gyration which we have been instructed by Philosophy to comprehend and to account for, at least in the
              best manner we can. Now and then, however, a philosopher proper &mdash; one whose phrenzy takes a very determinate turn &mdash; whose
              genius, to speak more reverentially, has a strongly-pronounced washer-womanish bias, doing every thing up by the dozen &mdash; enables
              us to see <i>precisely</i> that point out of sight, at which the revolutionary processes in question do, and of right ought to, come to
              an end. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It is hardly worth while, perhaps, even to sneer at the reveries of Fourrier [[Fourier]]: &mdash; but much has been
              said, latterly, of the hypothesis of M&auml;dler &mdash; that there exists, in the centre of the Galaxy, a stupendous globe about which
              all the systems of the cluster revolve. The <i>period</i> of our own, indeed, has been stated &mdash; 117 millions of years. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> That our Sun has a motion in space, independently of its rotation, and revolution about the system&rsquo;s centre of
              gravity, has long been suspected. This motion, granting it to exist, would be manifested perspectively. The stars in that firmamental
              region which we were leaving behind us, would, in a very long series of years, become crowded; those in the opposite quarter, scattered.
              Now, by means of astronomical History, we ascertain, cloudily, that some such ph&aelig;nomena have occurred. On this ground it has <span
                class="pgloc"><a name="pg0122">[page&nbsp;122:]</a></span> been declared that our system is moving to a point in the heavens
              diametrically opposite the star Zeta Herculis: &mdash; but this inference is, perhaps, the maximum to which we have any logical right.
              M&auml;dler, however, has gone so far as to designate a particular star, Alcyone in the Pleiades, as being at or about the very spot
              around which a general <i>revolution</i> is performed. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, since by &ldquo;analogy&rdquo; we are led, in the first instance, to these dreams, it is no more than proper that
              we should abide by analogy, at least in some measure, during their development; and that analogy which suggests the revolution, suggests
              at the same time a central orb about which it should be performed: &mdash; so far the astronomer was consistent. This central orb,
              however, should, dynamically, be greater than all the orbs, taken together, which surround it. Of these there are about 100 millions.
              &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; it was of course demanded, &ldquo;do we not <i>see</i> this vast central sun &mdash; <i>at least equal</i> in
              mass to 100 millions of such suns as ours &mdash; why do we not <i>see</i> it &mdash; <i>we</i>, especially, who occupy the mid region
              of the cluster &mdash; the very locality <i>near</i> which, at all events, must be situated this incomparable star?&rdquo; The reply was
              ready &mdash; &ldquo;It must be non-luminous, as are our planets.&rdquo; Here, then, to suit a purpose, analogy is suddenly let fall.
              &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; it may be said &mdash; &ldquo;we know that non-luminous suns actually exist.&rdquo; It is true that we have reason
              at least for supposing so; but we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that the non-luminous suns in question are encircled
              by <i>luminous</i> suns, while these again are surrounded by non-luminous planets: &mdash; and it is precisely all this with which
              M&auml;dler is <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0123">[page&nbsp;123:]</a></span> called upon to find any thing analogous in the heavens
              &mdash; for it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of the Galaxy. Admitting the thing to be so, we cannot help here
              picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the <i>why is it so</i> must prove to all <i>&agrave; priori</i> philosophers. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But granting, in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else, the non-luminosity of the vast central orb, we may
              still inquire how this orb, so enormous, could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it from the 100 millions
              of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it. Upon the urging of this question, the idea of an actually solid central sun
              appears, in some measure, to have been abandoned; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the cluster perform their
              revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common to all. Here again then, to suit a purpose, analogy is let fall. The
              planets of our system revolve, it is true, about a common centre of gravity; but they do this in connexion with, and in consequence of,
              a material sun whose mass more than counterbalances the rest of the system. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines. But this idea of the circle &mdash; an
              idea which, in view of all ordinary geometry, is merely the mathematical, as contradistinguished from the practical, idea &mdash; is, in
              sober fact, the <i>practical</i> conception which alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle with which we
              have to deal, at least in fancy, when we suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre of the Galaxy. Let the most vigorous
              of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0124"
                  >[page&nbsp;124:]</a></span> of a sweep so ineffable! It would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself,
              travelling <i>forever</i> upon the circumference of this unutterable circle, would still, <i>forever</i>, be travelling in a straight
              line. That the path of our Sun in such an orbit would, to any human perception, deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line,
              even in a million of years, is a proposition not to be entertained: &mdash; yet we are required to believe that a curvature has become
              apparent during the brief period of our astronomical history &mdash; during a mere point &mdash; during the utter nothingness of two or
              three thousand years. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It may be said that M&auml;dler <i>has</i> really ascertained a curvature in the direction of our system&rsquo;s now
              well-established progress through Space. Admitting, if necessary, this fact to be in reality such, I maintain that nothing is thereby
              shown except the reality of this fact &mdash; the fact of a curvature. For its <i>thorough</i> determination, ages will be required;
              and, when determined, it will be found indicative of some binary or other multiple relation between our Sun and some one or more of the
              proximate stars. I hazard nothing[[,]] however, in predicting, that, after the lapse of many centuries, all efforts at determining the
              path of our Sun through Space, will be abandoned as fruitless. This is easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of perturbation
              it must experience, from its perpetually-shifting relations with other orbs, in the common approach of all to the nucleus of the Galaxy. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But in examining other &ldquo;nebul&aelig;&rdquo; than that of the Milky Way &mdash; in surveying, generally, the
              clusters which overspread the heavens &mdash; do we or do we not find confirmation <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0125"
                  >[page&nbsp;125:]</a></span> of M&auml;dler&rsquo;s hypothesis? We do <i>not</i>. The forms of the clusters are exceedingly diverse
              when casually viewed; but on close inspection, through powerful telescopes, we recognize the sphere, very distinctly, as at least the
              proximate form of all: &mdash; their constitution, in general, being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common centre. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> &ldquo;It is difficult,&rdquo; says Sir John Herschell [[Herschel]], &ldquo;to form any conception of the dynamical
              state of such systems. On one hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a
              state of <i>progressive collapse</i>. On the other, granting such a motion and such a force, we find it no less difficult to reconcile
              their forms with the rotation of the whole system [meaning cluster] around any single axis, without which internal collision would
              appear to be inevitable.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Some remarks lately made about the &ldquo;nebul&aelig;&rdquo; by Dr. Nichol, in taking quite a different view of the
              cosmical conditions from any taken in this Discourse &mdash; have a very peculiar applicability to the point now at issue. He says: </p>
            <p class="flind4"> &ldquo;When our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them, we find that those which were thought to be
              irregular, are not so; they approach nearer to a globe. Here is one that looked oval; but Lord Rosse&rsquo;s telescope brought it into a
              circle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now there occurs a very remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping
              circular masses of nebul&aelig;. We find they are not entirely circular, but the reverse; and that all around them, on every side, there
              are volumes of stars, <i>stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards</i>
              <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0126">[page&nbsp;126:]</a></span>
              <i>a great central mass in consequence of the action of some great power</i>.&rdquo;<a name="tf12601" href="#fn12601">*</a>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Were I to describe, in my own words, what must necessarily be the existing condition of each nebula on the hypothesis
              that all matter is, as I suggest, now returning to its original Unity, I should simply be going over, nearly verbatim, the language here
              employed by Dr. Nichol, without the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key to these nebular ph&aelig;nomena. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> And here let me fortify my position still farther, by the voice of a greater than M&auml;dler &mdash; of one, moreover,
              to whom all the data of M&auml;dler have long been familiar things, carefully and thoroughly considered. Referring to the elaborate
              calculations of Argelander &mdash; the very researches which form M&auml;dler&rsquo;s basis &mdash; <i>Humboldt</i>, whose generalizing
              powers have never, perhaps been equalled, has the following observation: </p>
            <p class="flind4"> &ldquo;When we regard the real, proper, or non-perspective motions of the stars, we find <i>many groups of them moving
                in opposite directions;</i> and the data as yet in hand render it not necessary, at least, to conceive that the systems composing the
              Milky Way, or the clusters, generally, composing the Universe, are revolving about any particular centre unknown, whether luminous or
              non-luminous. It is but Man&rsquo;s longing for a fundamental First Cause, that impels <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0127"
                  >[page&nbsp;127:]</a></span> both his intellect and fancy to the adoption of such an hypothesis.&rdquo;<a name="tf12701"
                href="#fn12701">*</a>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The ph&aelig;nomenon here alluded to &mdash; that of &ldquo;many groups moving in opposite directions&rdquo; &mdash; is
              quite inexplicable by M&auml;dler&rsquo;s idea; but arises, as a necessary consequence, from that which forms the basis of this
              Discourse. While the <i>merely general direction</i> of each atom &mdash; of each moon, planet, star, or cluster &mdash; would, on my
              hypothesis, be, of course, absolutely rectilinear, while the <i>general</i> path of all bodies would be a right line leading to the
              centre of all; it is clear, nevertheless, that this general rectilinearity would be compounded of what, with scarcely any exaggeration,
              we may term an infinity of particular curves &mdash; an infinity of local deviations from rectilinearity &mdash; the result of
              continuous differences of relative position among the multudinous [[multitudinous]] masses, as each proceeded on its own proper journey
              to the End. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I quoted, just now, from Sir John Herschell [[Herschel]], the following words, used in reference to the clusters:
              &mdash; &ldquo;On one hand, without a rotary motion and a centrifugal force, it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of
                <i>progressive collapse</i>.&rdquo; The fact is, that, in surveying the &ldquo;nebul&aelig;&rdquo; <span class="pgloc"><a
                  name="pg0128">[page&nbsp;128:]</a></span> with a telescope of high power, we shall find it quite impossible, having once conceived
              this idea of &ldquo;collapse,&rdquo; not to gather, at all points, corroboration of the idea. A nucleus is always apparent, in the
              direction of which the stars seem to be precipitating themselves; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective
              ph&aelig;nomena: &mdash; the clusters are <i>really</i> denser near the centre &mdash; sparser in the regions more remote from it. In a
              word, we see every thing as we <i>should</i> see it were a collapse taking place; but, in general, it may be said of these clusters,
              that we can fairly entertain, while looking at them, the idea of <i>orbitual movement about a centre</i>, only by admitting the
                <i>possible</i> existence, in the distant domains of space, of dynamical laws with which <i>we</i> are unacquainted. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> On the part of Herschell [[Herschel]], however, there is evidently <i>a reluctance</i> to regard the nebul&aelig; as in
              &ldquo;a state of progressive collapse.&rdquo; But if facts &mdash; if even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this
              state, <i>why</i>, it may well be demanded, is he disinclined to admit it? Simply on account of a prejudice; &mdash; merely because the
              supposition is at war with a preconceived and utterly baseless notion &mdash; that of the endlessness &mdash; that of the eternal
              stability of the Universe. </p>
