            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0023">[page&nbsp;23:]</a></span>
              &ldquo;Infinity.&rdquo; This, like &ldquo;God,&rdquo; &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in
              all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea &mdash; but of an effort at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an
              impossible conception. Man needed a term by which to point out the <i>direction</i> of this effort &mdash; the cloud behind which lay,
              forever invisible, the <i>object</i> of this attempt. A word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself
              in relation at once with another human being and with a certain <i>tendency</i> of the human intellect. Out of this demand arose the
              word, &ldquo;Infinity;&rdquo; which is thus the representative but of the <i>thought of a thought</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> As regards <i>that</i> infinity now considered &mdash; the infinity of space &mdash; we often hear it said that
              &ldquo;its idea is admitted by the mind &mdash; is acquiesced in &mdash; is entertained &mdash; on account of the greater difficulty
              which attends the conception of a limit.&rdquo; But this is merely one of those <i>phrases</i> by which even profound thinkers, time out
              of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving <i>themselves</i>. The quibble lies concealed in the word
              &ldquo;difficulty.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mind,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;entertains the idea of <i>limitless</i>, through the greater
              <i>difficulty</i> which it finds in entertaining that of <i>limited</i>, space.&rdquo; Now, were the proposition but fairly <i>put</i>, its
              absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly, there is no mere <i>difficulty</i> in the case. The assertion intended, if
              presented <i>according</i> to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus: &mdash; &ldquo;The mind admits the idea of limitless,
              through the greater <i>impossibility</i> of entertaining that of limited, space.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It must be immediately seen that this is not a question <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0024">[page&nbsp;24:]</a></span>
              of two statements between whose respective credibilities &mdash; or of two arguments between whose respective validities &mdash; the
                <i>reason</i> is called upon to decide: &mdash; it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible,
              one of which the <i>intellect</i> is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater <i>impossibility</i> of
              entertaining the other. The choice is <i>not</i> made between two difficulties; &mdash; it is merely <i>fancied</i> to be made between
              two impossibilities. Now of the former, there <i>are</i> degrees, &mdash; but of the latter, none: &mdash; just as our impertinent
              letter-writer has already suggested. A task <i>may</i> be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible: &mdash;
              there are no gradations. It <i>might</i> be more <i>difficult</i> to overthrow the Andes than an ant-hill; but it <i>can</i> be no more
                <i>impossible</i> to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other. A man may jump ten feet with less
                <i>difficulty</i> than he can jump twenty, but the <i>impossibility</i> of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his
              leaping to the dog-star. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Since all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made between <i>impossibilities</i> of conception:
              since one impossibility cannot be greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another: the philosophers who not
              only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man&rsquo;s <i>idea</i> of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, <i>infinity
                itself</i> &mdash; are plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other
              thing &mdash; is impossible too. This, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is: &mdash; indeed <span class="pgloc"><a
                  name="pg0025">[page&nbsp;25:]</a></span> I think it very capital nonsense &mdash; but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply
              adverting to a <i>fact</i> respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked &mdash; the fact that the argument alluded to both
              proves and disproves its own proposition. &ldquo;The mind is impelled,&rdquo; say the theologians and others, &ldquo;to admit a <i>First
                Cause</i>, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end.&rdquo; The quibble, as before, lies
              in the word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; &mdash; but <i>here</i> what is it employed to sustain? A First Cause. And what is a First Cause?
              An ultimate termination of causes. And what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity &mdash; the Finite. Thus the one quibble, in
              two processes, by God knows how many philosophers, is made to support now Finity and now Infinity &mdash; could it not be brought to
              support something besides? As for the quibbles &mdash; <i>they</i>, at least, are insupportable. But &mdash; to dismiss them: &mdash;
              what they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Of course, no one will suppose that I here contend for the absolute impossibility of <i>that</i> which we attempt to
              convey in the word &ldquo;Infinity.&rdquo; My purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove Infinity itself, or even our
              conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Nevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to say that <i>I cannot</i> conceive Infinity, and am convinced that
              no human being can. A mind not thoroughly self-conscious <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0026">[page&nbsp;26:]</a></span> &mdash; not
              accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations &mdash; will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it
                <i>has</i> entertained the conception of which we speak. In the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step &mdash; we fancy
              point still beyond point; and so long as we <i>continue</i> the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are <i>tending</i> to the
              formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the
              period during which we keep up the mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor &mdash; of fulfilling (as we
              think) the idea &mdash; of putting the finishing stroke (as we suppose) to the conception &mdash; that we overthrow at once the whole
              fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account
              of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking. &mdash; In
              attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a <i>limited</i> space, we merely converse the processes which involve the
              impossibility. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> We <i>believe</i> in a God. We may or may not <i>believe</i> in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such
              cases, is more properly designated as <i>faith</i>, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper &mdash; from that
                <i>intellectual</i> belief &mdash; which presupposes the mental conception. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which &ldquo;Infinity&rdquo; belongs
              &mdash; the class representing <i>thoughts of thought</i> &mdash; he who has a right to say that he thinks <i>at all</i>, feels himself
              called upon, <i>not</i> to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0027"
                  >[page&nbsp;27:]</a></span> toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To
              solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human
              purposes, the <i>inessentiality</i>, of its solution. He perceives that the Deity has not <i>designed</i> it to be solved. He sees, at
              once, that it lies <i>out</i> of the brain of man, and even <i>how</i>, if not exactly <i>why</i>, it lies out of it. There <i>are</i>
              people, I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among
              those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the
              finest quality of Thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be
              greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from
              comprehension. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It will now be understood that, in using the phrase, &ldquo;Infinity of Space,&rdquo; I make no call upon the reader to
              entertain the impossible conception of an <i>absolute</i> infinity. I refer simply to the &ldquo;<i>utmost conceivable
              expanse</i>&rdquo; of space &mdash; a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating
              energies of the imagination. </p>
            <p class="flind4">
              <i>Hitherto</i>, the Universe of stars has always been considered coincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the
              commencement of this Discourse. It has been always either directly or indirectly assumed &mdash; at least since the dawn of intelligible
              Astronomy &mdash; that, were it <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0028">[page&nbsp;28:]</a></span> possible for us to attain any given
              point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal
              when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word
              &ldquo;Universe.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is a sphere,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference,
              nowhere.&rdquo; But although this intended definition is, in fact, <i>no</i> definition of the Universe of <i>stars</i>, we may accept
              it, with some mental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical purposes) of the Universe <i>proper</i> &mdash;
              that is to say, of the Universe of <i>space</i>. This latter, then, let us regard as &ldquo;<i>a sphere of which the centre is
                everywhere, the circumference nowhere</i>.&rdquo; In fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an <i>end</i> to space, we have no
              difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of <i>beginnings</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> As our starting-point, then, let us adopt the <i>Godhead</i>. Of this Godhead, <i>in itself</i>, he alone is not
              imbecile &mdash; he alone is not impious who propounds &mdash;&mdash; nothing. &ldquo;<i>Nous ne connaissons rien</i>,&rdquo; says the Baron de
              Bielfeld &mdash; &ldquo;<i>Nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l&rsquo;essence de Dieu: &mdash; pour savoir ce qu&rsquo;il est,
                il faut &ecirc;tre Dieu m&ecirc;me</i>.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;We know absolutely <i>nothing</i> of the nature or essence of God:
              &mdash; in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be God ourselves.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> &ldquo;<i>We should have to be God ourselves!</i>&rdquo; &mdash; With a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my
              ears, I nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the Deity is an ignorance to which the soul is
                <i>everlastingly</i> condemned. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> By <i>Him</i>, however &mdash; <i>now</i>, at least, the Incomprehensible <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0029"
                  >[page&nbsp;29:]</a></span> &mdash; by Him &mdash; assuming him as <i>Spirit</i> &mdash; that is to say, as <i>not Matter</i>
              &mdash; a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition &mdash; by Him, then, existing as
              Spirit, let us content ourselves with supposing to have been <i>created</i>, or made out of Nothing, by dint of his Volition &mdash; at
              some point of Space which we will take as a centre &mdash; at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events
              immensely remote &mdash; by Him, then again, let us suppose to have been created &mdash;&mdash; <i>what?</i> This is a vitally momentous
              epoch in our considerations. <i>What</i> is it that we are justified &mdash; that alone we are justified in supposing to have been,
              primarily and solely, <i>created?</i>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> We have attained a point where only <i>Intuition</i> can aid us: &mdash; but now let me recur to the idea which I have
              already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition. It is but <i>the conviction arising from those inductions
                or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of
                expression</i>. With this understanding, I now assert &mdash; that an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible,
              forces me to the conclusion that what God originally created &mdash; that that Matter which, by dint of his Volition, he first made from
              his Spirit, or from Nihility, <i>could</i> have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable state of &mdash;&mdash; what? &mdash; of
                <i>Simplicity</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> This will be found the sole absolute <i>assumption</i> of my Discourse. I use the word &ldquo;assumption&rdquo; in its
              ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere <span
                class="pgloc"><a name="pg0030">[page&nbsp;30:]</a></span> assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly &mdash; no human conclusion was
              ever, in fact, more regularly &mdash; more rigorously <i>de</i>duced: &mdash; but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis
              &mdash; at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of <i>Simplicity</i>. Here
              the Reason flies at once to Imparticularity &mdash; to a particle &mdash; to <i>one</i> particle &mdash; a particle of <i>one</i> kind
              &mdash; of <i>one</i> character &mdash; of <i>one</i> nature &mdash; of <i>one size</i> &mdash; of one form &mdash; a particle,
              therefore, &ldquo;<i>without</i> form and void&rdquo; &mdash; a particle positively a particle at all points &mdash; a particle
              absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because He who <i>created</i> it, by dint of his Will, can by an
              infinitely less energetic exercise of the same Will, as a matter of course, divide it. </p>
            <p class="flind4">
              <i>Oneness</i>, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created Matter; but I propose to show that this <i>Oneness is a
                principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing ph&aelig;nomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation
                of at least the material Universe</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the <i>conception</i>, of
              Creation. We now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the Particle created &mdash; that is to say, the ultimate
              purpose so far as our considerations <i>yet</i> enable us to see it &mdash; the constitution of the Universe from it, the Particle. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> This constitution has been effected by <i>forcing</i> the originally and therefore normally <i>One</i> into the
              abnormal condition of <i>Many</i>. An action of this character implies r&euml;action. A diffusion from Unity, under the conditions,
              involves <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0031">[page&nbsp;31:]</a></span> a tendency to return into Unity &mdash; a tendency ineradicable
              until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more fully hereafter. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes that of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive the
              Particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into Space. From the one Particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be
              radiated spherically &mdash; in all directions &mdash; to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space
              &mdash; a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted &mdash; not to assume, but to
              infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? <i>Unity</i> being
              their source, and <i>difference from Unity</i> the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing
              this character to be at least <i>generally</i> preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself: &mdash; that
              is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. But,
              for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? More explicitly
              &mdash; are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size? &mdash;
              and, after fulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? In
              such arrangement, under such conditions, we <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0032">[page&nbsp;32:]</a></span> most easily and immediately
              comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which I have suggested &mdash; the design
              of variety out of unity &mdash; diversity out of sameness &mdash; heterogeneity out of homogeneity &mdash; complexity out of simplicity
              &mdash; in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of <i>relation</i> out of the emphatically irrelative <i>One</i>. Undoubtedly,
              therefore, we <i>should</i> be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is
              not presumable of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in
              question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist. I mean to say that some are involved in
              the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable. Difference of <i>size</i>, for example,
              will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular
              inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as <i>particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of
                different form</i> &mdash; a matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms. Difference of
                <i>kind</i>, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly: &mdash; in
              fact, since the <i>Unity</i> of the Particle Proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion,
              differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the Divine Will, at the emission of each atom, for the
              purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature: &mdash; so fantastic an idea is <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0033"
                  >[page&nbsp;33:]</a></span> the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute
              and elaborate interposition. We perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical,
              to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than <i>difference of form</i> at their dispersion, with particular
              inequidistance after it &mdash; all other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution:
              &mdash; We thus establish the Universe on a purely <i>geometrical</i> basis. Of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute
              difference, even of form, among <i>all</i> the atoms radiated &mdash; any more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from
              each. We are required to conceive merely that no <i>neighboring</i> atoms are of similar form &mdash; no atoms which can ever
              approximate, until their inevitable r&euml;unition at the end. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Although the immediate and perpetual <i>tendency</i> of the disunited atoms to return into their normal Unity, is
              implied, as I have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence &mdash; a
              tendency and no more &mdash; until the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave <i>it</i>, the tendency, free to seek its
              satisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand,
              at once, a <i>r&euml;action</i> &mdash; in other words, a <i>satisfiable</i> tendency of the disunited atoms to return into <i>One</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the r&euml;action having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design
              &mdash; <i>that of the utmost possible Relation</i> &mdash; this design is <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0034"
                >[page&nbsp;34:]</a></span> now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect
              its accomplishment in general. <i>Multiplicity</i> is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing <i>at
                once</i>, through the now satisfiable tendency &mdash; <i>before</i> the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity &mdash; into
              absolute oneness among themselves: &mdash; there is nothing to impede the aggregation of various <i>unique</i> masses, at various points
              of space: &mdash; in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely One. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> For the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited
              capacity &mdash; a separate <i>something</i> which, on withdrawal of the diffusive Volition, shall at the same time allow the approach,
              and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having
              the power &mdash; <i>up to a certain epoch</i> &mdash; of preventing their <i>coalition</i>, but no ability to interfere with their
                <i>coalescence</i> in any respect <i>or degree</i>. The repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must
              be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, <i>only up to a certain epoch</i>. Unless we are to
              conceive that the appetite for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied <i>never;</i> &mdash; unless we are to conceive that what
              had a beginning is to have no end &mdash; a conception which cannot <i>really</i> be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of
              entertaining it &mdash; we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally &mdash; under pressure of the
              Uni-tendency <i>collectively</i> applied, but never and in no degree <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0035">[page&nbsp;35:]</a></span>
              <i>until</i>, on fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made &mdash; yield to a force which,
              at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the
              inevitable, because original and therefore normal, <i>One</i>. &mdash; The conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed:
              &mdash; we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation; &mdash; nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly
              suggestive. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> That the repulsive something actually exists, <i>we see</i>. Man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to
              bring two atoms into contact. This is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter. All Experiment proves
              &mdash; all Philosophy admits it. The <i>design</i> of the repulsion &mdash; the necessity for its existence &mdash; I have endeavored
              to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that
              the principle at issue is strictly spiritual &mdash; lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding &mdash; lies involved in a
              consideration of what now &mdash; in our human state &mdash; is <i>not</i> to be considered &mdash; in a consideration of <i>Spirit in
                itself</i>. I feel, in a word, that here the God has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the
              interposition of the God. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into Unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle
              of the Newtonian Gravity, what I have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the (immediate) satisfaction of the
              tendency, will be understood as <i>that</i> which we have been in the practice of designating now as <span class="pgloc"><a
                  name="pg0036">[page&nbsp;36:]</a></span> heat, now as magnetism, now as <i>electricity;</i> displaying our ignorance of its awful
              character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an
              ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, <i>heterogeneity</i>. <i>Only</i> where things differ is electricity apparent; and
              it is presumable that they <i>never</i> differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now, this result is in the fullest
              keeping with that which I have reached unempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained to be that of preventing
              immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each. <i>Difference</i> is their
              character &mdash; their essentiality &mdash; just as <i>no-difference</i> was the essentiality of their source. When we say, then, that
              an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the
              contact, we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a
              development of electricity. All existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be
              considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any
              two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each: &mdash; an expression which, when reduced, is
              equivalent to this: &mdash; <i>The amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies</i>, <i>is proportional</i>
              <span class="pgloc"><a name="pg0037">[page&nbsp;37:]</a></span>
              <i>with the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed</i>. That <i>no</i> two bodies are
              absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore, existing always, is <i>developed</i>
              whenever <i>any</i> bodies, but <i>manifested</i> only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To electricity &mdash; so, for the present, continuing to call it &mdash; we <i>may</i> not be wrong in referring the
              various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly
              spiritual principle the more important ph&aelig;nomena of vitality, consciousness and <i>Thought</i>. On this topic, however, I need
              pause <i>here</i> merely to suggest that these ph&aelig;nomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed <i>at least in
                the ratio of the heterogeneous</i>. </p>
