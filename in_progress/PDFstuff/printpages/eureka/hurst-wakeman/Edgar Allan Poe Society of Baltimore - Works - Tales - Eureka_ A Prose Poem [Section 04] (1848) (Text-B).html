              <span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;52, continued:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The process of thought, at this point, may be thus roughly sketched: &mdash; I say to myself &mdash; &ldquo;Unity, as I
              have <a name="pg0053">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;53:]</span> explained it, is a truth &mdash; I feel it. Diffusion is a
              truth &mdash; I see it. Radiation, by which alone these two truths are reconciled, is a consequent truth &mdash; I perceive it.
                <i>Equability</i> of diffusion, first deduced <i>&agrave; priori</i> and then corroborated by the inspection of ph&aelig;nomena, is
              also a truth &mdash; I fully admit it. So far all is clear around me: &mdash; there are no clouds behind which <i>the</i> secret &mdash;
              the great secret of the gravitating <i>modus operandi</i> &mdash; can possibly lie hidden; &mdash; but this secret lies
                <i>hereabouts</i>, most assuredly; and <i>were</i> there but a cloud in view, I should be driven to suspicion of that cloud.&rdquo;
              And now, just as I say this, there actually comes a cloud into view. This cloud is the seeming impossibility of reconciling my truth,
                <i>radiation</i>, with my truth, <i>equability of diffusion</i>. I say now: &mdash; &ldquo;Behind this <i>seeming</i> impossibility is
              to be found what I desire.&rdquo; I do not say &ldquo;<i>real</i> impossibility;&rdquo; for invincible faith in my truths assures me
              that it is a mere difficulty, after all &mdash; but I go on to say, with unflinching confidence, that, <i>when</i> this
                <i>difficulty</i> shall be solved, we shall find, <i>wrapped up in the process of solution</i>, the key to the secret at which we aim.
              Moreover &mdash; I <i>feel</i> that we shall discover <i>but one</i> possible solution of the difficulty; this for the reason that, were
              there two, one would be supererogatory &mdash; would be fruitless &mdash; would be empty &mdash; would contain no key &mdash; since no
              duplicate key can be needed to any secret of Nature. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> And now, let us see: &mdash; Our usual notions of radiation &mdash; in fact <i>all</i> our distinct notions of it
              &mdash; are caught merely from the process as we see it exemplified in <i>Light</i>. Here there is a <i>continuous</i> outpouring of
                <i>ray-streams</i>, and <i>with a force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at</i>
              <a name="pg0054">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;54:]</span>
              <i>all</i>. Now, in any such radiation <i>as this</i> &mdash; continuous and of unvarying force &mdash; the regions nearer the centre
              must <i>inevitably</i> be always more crowded with the radiated matter than the regions more remote. But I have assumed <i>no</i> such
              radiation as this. I assumed no <i>continuous</i> radiation; and for the simple reason that such an assumption would have involved,
              first, the necessity of entertaining a conception which I have shown no man <i>can</i> entertain, and which (as I will more fully
              explain hereafter) all observation of the firmament refutes &mdash; the conception of the absolute infinity of the Universe of Stars
              &mdash; and would have involved, secondly, the impossibility of understanding a r&euml;action &mdash; that is, gravitation &mdash; as
              existing now &mdash; since, while an act is continued, no r&euml;action, of course, can take place. My assumption, then &mdash; or
              rather my inevitable deduction from just premises &mdash; was that of a <i>determinate</i> radiation &mdash; one finally
              <i>dis</i>continued. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through
              space, so as to fulfil the conditions at once of radiation and of generally equable distribution. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> For convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the first place, a hollow sphere of glass, or of anything else,
              occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equably diffused, by means of radiation, from the absolute,
              irrelative, unconditional Particle, placed in the centre of the sphere. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed to be the Divine Volition) &mdash; in other words, a certain
                <i>force</i> &mdash; whose measure is the quantity of matter &mdash; that <a name="pg0055">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;55:]</span> is to say, the number of atoms &mdash; emitted; emits, by radiation, this certain number of atoms; forcing
              them in all directions outwardly from the centre &mdash; their proximity to each other diminishing as they proceed &mdash; until,
              finally, they are distributed, loosely, over the interior surface of the sphere. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> When these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to attain it, a second and inferior exercise of the
              same force &mdash; or a second and inferior force of the same character &mdash; emits, in the same manner &mdash; that is to say, by
              radiation as before &mdash; a second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of atoms, in this case
              as in the former, being of course the measure of the force which emitted them; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the
              purpose it effects &mdash; the force and the number of atoms sent out by the force, being <i>directly proportional</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> When this second stratum has reached its destined position &mdash; or while approaching it &mdash; a third still
              inferior exertion of the force, or a third inferior force of a similar character &mdash; the number of atoms emitted being in <i>all</i>
              cases the measure of the force &mdash; proceeds to deposit a third stratum upon the second: &mdash; and so on, until these concentric
              strata, growing gradually less and less, come down at length to the central point; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with the
              diffusive force, is exhausted. [[Poe inserts at this point a note to: &ldquo;Here describe the whole process as one instantaneous
              flash.&rdquo;]] </p>
            <p class="flind4"> We have now the sphere filled, through means of radiation, with atoms equably diffused. The two necessary conditions
              &mdash; those of radiation and of equable diffusion &mdash; are satisfied; and by the <i>sole</i> process in which the possibility <a
                name="pg0056">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;56:]</span> of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. For this reason,
              I confidently expect to find, lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere, the secret of which I
              am in search &mdash; the all-important principle of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Newtonian law. Let us examine, then, the actual
              condition of the atoms. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> They lie in a series of concentric strata. They are equably diffused throughout the sphere. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The atoms being <i>equably</i> distributed, the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata, or
              spheres, the more atoms will lie upon it. In other words, the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric
              spheres, is directly proportional with the extent of that surface. </p>
            <p class="flind4">
              <i>But, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the
                centre</i>.<a name="tf05601" href="#fn05601">*</a>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum&rsquo;s distance
              from the centre. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that stratum &mdash; that is to say,
              is <i>directly proportional</i> with the force. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Therefore the force which radiated any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum&rsquo;s
              distance from the centre: &mdash; or, generally, </p>
            <p class="flind4">
              <i>The force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the distances:</i> &mdash; or particularly, </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The force by which any individual atom was sent to its position in the sphere, was directly proportional with the
              square of that atom&rsquo;s distance, while in that position, from the center of the sphere. <a name="pg0057">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;57:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, R&euml;action, as far as we know anything of it, is Action conversed. The <i>general</i> principle of Gravity
              being, in the first place, understood as the r&euml;action of an act &mdash; as the expression of a desire on the part of Matter, while
              existing in a state of diffusion, to return into the Unity whence it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being called on to
              determine the <i>character</i> of the desire &mdash; the manner in which it would, naturally, be manifested; in other words, being
              called on to conceive a probable law, or <i>modus operandi</i>, for the return; could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this
              law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure. That such would be the case, any one, at least, would be
              abundantly justified in taking for granted, until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it
              should <i>not</i> be the case &mdash; until such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as
              preferable. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Matter, then, radiated into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances, might, <i>&agrave; priori</i>,
              be supposed to return towards its centre of radiation with a force varying <i>inversely</i> as the squares of the distances: and I have
              already shown<a name="tf05701" href="#fn05701">*</a> that any principle which will explain why the atoms should tend, according to any
              law, to the general centre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining, at the same time, why, according to the same law, they should
              tend each to each. For, in fact, the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but because of its being a point in
              tending towards which each atom tends <a name="pg0058">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;58:]</span> most directly to its real and
              essential centre, <i>Unity</i> &mdash; the absolute and final Union of all. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment whatever &mdash; but this fact does not blind
              me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with abstractions: &mdash; and, on
              the whole, it may be as well to look at the matter from one or two other points of view. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The absolute, irrelative particle primarily created by the Volition of God, must have been in a condition of positive
                <i>normality</i>, or rightfulness &mdash; for wrongfulness implies <i>relation</i>. Right is positive; wrong is negative &mdash; is
              merely the negation of right; as cold is the negation of heat &mdash; darkness of light. That a thing may be wrong, it is necessary that
              there be some other thing in <i>relation</i> to which it <i>is</i> wrong &mdash; some condition which it fails to satisfy; some law
              which it violates; some being whom it aggrieves. If there be no such being, law, or condition, in respect to which the thing is wrong
              &mdash; and, still more especially, if no beings, laws, or conditions exist at all &mdash; then the thing can<i>not</i> be wrong and
              consequently must be <i>right</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Any deviation from normality involves a tendency to return into it. A difference from the normal &mdash; from the right
              &mdash; from the just &mdash; can be understood as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty; and if the force which overcomes the
              difficulty be not infinitely continued, the ineradicable tendency to return will at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction.
              On withdrawal of the force, the tendency acts. This is the principle of r&euml;action as the inevitable consequence of finite action.
              Employing a phraseology of which the seeming <a name="pg0059">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;59:]</span> affectation will be
              pardoned for its expressiveness, we may say that R&euml;action is the return from the condition of <i>as it is and ought not to be</i>
              into the condition of <i>as it was, originally, and therefore ought to be:</i> &mdash; and let me add here that the <i>absolute</i>
              force of R&euml;action would no doubt be always found in direct proportion with the reality &mdash; the truth &mdash; the absoluteness
              &mdash; of the <i>originality</i> &mdash; if ever it were possible to measure this latter: &mdash; and, consequently, the greatest of
              all conceivable r&euml;actions must be that manifested in the tendency which we now discuss &mdash; the tendency to return into the
                <i>absolutely</i> original &mdash; into the <i>supremely</i> primitive. Gravity, then, <i>must be the strongest of forces</i> &mdash;
              an idea reached <i>&agrave; priori</i> and abundantly confirmed by induction. What use I make of the idea, will be seen in the sequel. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The atoms, now, having been diffused from their normal condition of Unity, seek to return to &mdash;&mdash; what? Not
              to any particular <i>point</i>, certainly; for it is clear that if, on the diffusion, the whole Universe of matter had been projected,
              collectively, to a distance from the point of radiation, the atomic tendency to the general centre of the sphere would not have been
              disturbed in the least; the atoms would not have sought the point <i>in absolute space</i> from which they were originally impelled. It
              is merely the <i>condition</i>, and not the point or locality at which this condition took its rise, that these atoms seek to
              re-establish; &mdash; it is merely <i>that condition which is their normality</i>, that they desire. &ldquo;But they seek a
              centre,&rdquo; it will be said, &ldquo;and a centre is a point.&rdquo; True; but they seek this point not in its character of point
              &mdash; (for, were the whole sphere moved from its position, they would seek, equally, the centre; <a name="pg0060">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;60:]</span> and the centre <i>then</i> would be a <i>new</i> point) &mdash; but because it so happens, on
              account of the form in which they collectively exist &mdash; (that of the sphere) &mdash; that only <i>through</i> the point in question
              &mdash; the sphere&rsquo;s centre &mdash; they can attain their true object, Unity. In the direction of the centre each atom perceives
              more atoms than in any other direction. Each atom is impelled towards the centre because along the straight line joining it and the
              centre and passing on to the surface beyond, there lie a greater number of atoms than along any other straight line joining it, the
              atom, with any point of the sphere &mdash; a greater number of objects that seek it, the individual atom &mdash; a greater number of
              tendencies to Unity &mdash; a greater number of satisfactions for its own tendency to Unity &mdash; in a word, because in the direction
              of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction, generally, for its own individual appetite. To be brief, the
              <i>condition</i>, Unity, is all that is really sought; and if the atoms <i>seem</i> to seek the centre of the sphere, it is only
              impliedly &mdash; through implication &mdash; because such centre happens to imply, to include, or to involve, the only essential
              centre, Unity. But <i>on account of</i> this implication or involution, there is no possibility of practically separating the tendency
              to Unity in the abstract, from the tendency to the concrete centre. Thus the tendency of the atoms to the general centre <i>is</i>, to
              all practical intents and for all logical purposes, the tendency each to each; and the tendency each to each <i>is</i> the tendency to
              the centre; and the one tendency may be assumed <i>as</i> the other; whatever will apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the
              other; and, in conclusion, whatever principle will satisfactorily explain the one, cannot be questioned as an explanation of the other.
                <a name="pg0061">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;61:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In looking carefully around me for rational objection to what I have advanced, I am able to discover nothing; &mdash;
              but of that class of objections usually urged by the doubters for Doubt&rsquo;s sake, I very readily perceive <i>three;</i> and proceed
              to dispose of them in order. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It may be said, first: &ldquo;That the proof that the force of radiation (in the case described) is directly
              proportional with the squares of the distances, depends on an unwarranted assumption &mdash; that of the number of atoms in each stratum
              being the measure of the force with which they are emitted.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I reply, not only that I am warranted in such assumption, but that I should be utterly <i>un</i>warranted in any other.
              What I assume is, simply, that an effect is the measure of its cause &mdash; that every exercise of the Divine Will will be proportional
              with that which demands the exertion &mdash; that the means of Omnipotence, or of Omniscience, will be exactly adapted to its purposes.
              Neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to pass any effect. Had the force which radiated any stratum to its position, been
              either more or less than was needed for the purpose &mdash; that is to say, not <i>directly proportional</i> with the purpose &mdash;
              then to its position that stratum could not have been radiated. Had the force which, with a view to general equability of distribution,
              emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum, been not <i>directly proportional</i> with the number, then the number would
                <i>not</i> have been the number demanded for the equable distribution. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The second supposable objection is somewhat better entitled to an answer. <a name="pg0062">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;62:]</span>

            <p class="flind4"> It is an admitted principle in Dynamics that every body, on receiving an impulse, or disposition to move, will move
              onward in a straight line, in the direction imparted by the impelling force, until deflected, or stopped, by some other force. How then,
              it may be asked, is my first or external stratum of atoms to be understood as discontinuing their movement at the surface of the
              imaginary glass sphere, when no second force, of more than an imaginary character, appears, to account for the discontinuance? </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I reply that the objection, in this case, actually does arise out of &ldquo;an unwarranted assumption&rdquo; &mdash; on
              the part of the objector &mdash; the assumption of a principle, in Dynamics, at an epoch when <i>no</i> &ldquo;principles,&rdquo; in
                <i>anything</i>, exist: &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;principle,&rdquo; of course, in the objector&rsquo;s understanding of the word. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> &ldquo;In the beginning&rdquo; we can admit &mdash; indeed we can comprehend &mdash; but one <i>First Cause</i> &mdash;
              the truly ultimate <i>Principle</i> &mdash; the Volition of God. The primary <i>act</i> &mdash; that of Radiation from Unity &mdash;
              must have been independent of all that which the world now calls &ldquo;principle&rdquo; &mdash; because all that we so designate is but
              a consequence of the r&euml;action of that primary act: &mdash; I say &ldquo;<i>primary</i>&rdquo; act; for the creation of the absolute
              material Particle is more properly to be regarded as a <i>conception</i> than as an &ldquo;<i>act</i>&rdquo; in the ordinary meaning of
              the term. Thus, we must regard the primary act as an act for the establishment of what we now call &ldquo;principles.&rdquo; But this
              primary act itself is to be considered as <i>continuous Volition</i>. The Thought of God is to be understood as originating the
              Diffusion &mdash; as proceeding with it &mdash; as regulating it &mdash; and, finally, as being <a name="pg0063">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;63:]</span> withdrawn from it on its completion. <i>Then</i> commences R&euml;action, and through
              R&euml;action, &ldquo;Principle,&rdquo; as we employ the word. It will be advisable, however, to limit the application of this word to
              the two <i>immediate</i> results of the discontinuance of the Divine Volition &mdash; that is, to the two agents, <i>Attraction</i> and
                <i>Repulsion</i>. Every other Natural agent depends, either more or less immediately, on these two, and therefore would be more
              conveniently designated as <i>sub</i>-principle. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It may be objected, thirdly, that, in general, the peculiar mode of distribution which I have suggested for the atoms,
              is &ldquo;an hypothesis and nothing more.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, I am aware that the word &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; is a ponderous sledge-hammer, grasped immediately, if not
              lifted, by all very diminutive thinkers, on the first appearance of any proposition wearing, in any particular, the garb of <i>a
                theory</i>. But &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; cannot be wielded <i>here</i> to any good purpose, even by those who succeed in lifting it
              &mdash; little men or great. </p>

                <p> The additional sentence Poe added to the single sentence at the bottom of page 56 was written across the bottom of facing pages 56
                  and 57. </p>
                <p> On page 61, Poe crosses out the &ldquo;to&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;with a view to general equability&rdquo; towards the end of
                  the paragraph beginning &ldquo;I reply, not only that I am warranted . . .,&rdquo; but apparently in error, and thus the change is
                  not implemented here. Poe probably mistook it for the &ldquo;to&rdquo; two lines futher on, which he did want to replace by
                  &ldquo;with&rdquo;. </p>
