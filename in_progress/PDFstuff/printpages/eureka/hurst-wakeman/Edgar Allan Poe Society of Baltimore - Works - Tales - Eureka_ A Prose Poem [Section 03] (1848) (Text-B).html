            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Discarding now the two equivocal terms, &ldquo;gravitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;electricity,&rdquo; let us adopt the more
              definite expressions, &ldquo;<i>Attraction</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Repulsion</i>.&rdquo; The former is the body; the latter the soul:
              the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. <i>No other principles exist</i>. <i>All</i>
              ph&aelig;nomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the case &mdash; so thoroughly
              demonstrable is it that Attraction and Repulsion are the <i>sole</i> properties through which we perceive the Universe &mdash; in other
              words, by which Matter is manifested to Mind &mdash; that, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming
              that Matter <i>exists</i> only as Attraction and Repulsion &mdash; that Attraction and Repulsion <i>are</i> matter: &mdash; there being
              no conceivable case in which we <a name="pg0038">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;38:]</span> may not employ the term
              &ldquo;Matter&rdquo; and the terms &ldquo;Attraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Repulsion,&rdquo; taken together, as equivalent, and therefore
              convertible, expressions in Logic. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original Unity,
              would be understood as the principle of the Newtonian law of Gravity: and, in fact, there can be little difficulty in such an
              understanding, if we look at the Newtonian Gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling Matter to seek Matter; that is to say,
              when we pay no attention to the known <i>modus operandi</i> of the Newtonian force. The general c&ouml;incidence satisfies us; but, on
              looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears <i>in</i>c&ouml;incident, and much in regard to which no c&ouml;incidence, at
              least, is established. For exampl; the Newtonian Gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does <i>not</i> seem to be a tendency to
                <i>oneness</i> at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions &mdash; a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to
              diffusion. Here, then, is an <i>in</i>c&ouml;incidence. Again; when we reflect on the mathematical <i>law</i> governing the Newtonian
              tendency, we see clearly that no c&ouml;incidence has been made good, in respect of the <i>modus operandi</i>, at least, between gravity
              as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which I have assumed. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes. So
              far, we have gone on <i>&agrave; priori</i>, from an abstract consideration of <i>Simplicity</i>, as that quality most likely to have
              characterized the original action of God. Let us now see whether the established facts of the Newtonian Gravitation <a name="pg0039"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;39:]</span> may not afford us, <i>&agrave; posteriori</i>, some legitimate inductions. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> What does the Newtonian law declare? &mdash; That all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their
              quantities of matter and inversely proportional with the squares of their distances. Purposely, I have here given, in the first place,
              the vulgar version of the law; and I confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a
              suggestive character. Let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology: &mdash; <i>Every atom, of every body, attracts every other
                atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the
                attracting and attracted atom</i>. &mdash; Here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But let us see distinctly what it was that Newton <i>proved</i> &mdash; according to the grossly irrational definitions
              of <i>proof</i> prescribed by the metaphysical schools. He was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an
              imaginary Universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually
              existing Universe so far as it comes under our observation. This was the amount of his <i>demonstration</i> &mdash; that is to say, this
              was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the &ldquo;philosophies.&rdquo; His successors added proof multiplied by
              proof &mdash; such proof as a sound intellect admits &mdash; but the <i>demonstration</i> of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians,
              had not been strengthened in any degree. &ldquo;<i>Ocular, physical</i> proof,&rdquo; however, of Attraction, here upon Earth, in
              accordance with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the <a name="pg0040">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;40:]</span>
              satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This proof arose collaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths
              have arisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the Earth. In the famous Maskelyne, Cavendish and Bailly experiments for
              this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain<a name="tf04001" href="#fn04001">*</a> was seen, felt, measured, and found to be
              mathematically consistent with the theory of the British astronomer. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none &mdash; in spite of the so-called corroboration of the
              &ldquo;theory&rdquo; by the so-called &ldquo;ocular and physical proof&rdquo; &mdash; in spite of the <i>character</i> of this
              corroboration &mdash; the ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of Gravity &mdash; and, especially, the ideas
              of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are <i>seen</i> to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of
              the principle as they find it developed &mdash; <i>merely in the planet on which they stand</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, to what does so partial a consideration tend &mdash; to what species of error does it give rise? On the Earth we
                <i>see</i> and <i>feel</i>, only that Gravity impels all bodies towards the <i>centre</i> of the Earth. No man in the common walks of
              life could be <i>made</i> to see or feel anything else &mdash; could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual,
              gravitating tendency in any <i>other</i> direction than to the centre of the Earth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it
              is a fact that every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has a tendency not <i>only</i> to the Earth&rsquo;s centre
              but in every conceivable direction besides. <a name="pg0041">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;41:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, although the philosophic cannot be said to <i>err with</i> the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit
              themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the <i>sentiment</i> of the vulgar idea. &ldquo;Although the Pagan fables are not
              believed,&rdquo; says Bryant, in his very erudite &ldquo;Mythology,&rdquo; &ldquo;yet we forget ourselves continually and make
              inferences from them as from existing realities.&rdquo; I mean to assert that the merely <i>sensitive perception</i> of Gravity as we
              experience it on Earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of <i>concentralization</i> or <i>especiality</i> respecting it &mdash; has been
              continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects &mdash; perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from
              the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which
              lies in a diametrically opposite direction &mdash; behind the principle&rsquo;s <i>essential</i> characteristics &mdash; those,
                <i>not</i> of concentralization or especiality &mdash; but of <i>universality</i> and <i>diffusion</i>. This &ldquo;vital truth&rdquo;
              is <i>Unity</i> as the <i>source</i> of the ph&aelig;nomenon. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let me now repeat the definition of Gravity: &mdash; <i>Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of
                its own and of every other body</i>, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and
              attracted atom. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous &mdash; of the ineffable &mdash; of
              the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that <i>each atom attracts every other atom</i> &mdash; involved
              merely in this fact of the Attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the Attraction is manifested &mdash; <a
                name="pg0042">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;42:]</span> involved <i>merely</i> in the fact that each atom attracts every
              other atom <i>at all</i>, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed,
              probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the Universe. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one point, a favorite with all &mdash; we should still have
              fallen upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind: &mdash; but what is it that we are actually called
              on to comprehend? That each atom attracts &mdash; sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and
              with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is
              utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam on its neighboring mote, I
              cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the Universe and defining the precise positions of all
              at one particular moment. If I venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies
              now on the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which I have adventured? I have done a deed which shakes the Moon
              in her path, which causes the Sun to be no longer the Sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars
              that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their Creator. </p>
            <p class="flind4">
              <i>These</i> ideas &mdash; conceptions such as <i>these</i> &mdash; unthoughtlike thoughts &mdash; soul-reveries rather than conclusions
              or even <a name="pg0043">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;43:]</span> considerations of the intellect: &mdash; ideas, I repeat,
              such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, <i>Attraction</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But now, &mdash; <i>with</i> such ideas &mdash; with such a <i>vision</i> of the marvellous complexity of Attraction
              fairly in his mind &mdash; let any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a
                <i>principle</i> for the ph&aelig;nomena observed &mdash; a condition from which they sprang. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so
              ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? Does not one extreme impel the reason to the
              other? Does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? Does not the entireness of the complex hint at the
              perfection of the simple? It is <i>not</i> that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations
              &mdash; but that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex: &mdash; it is the extremeness of the conditions to which I now
              allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. In a word, is it not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even
                <i>more than together</i> &mdash; is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were <i>One</i> &mdash; that now, in all
              circumstances &mdash; at all points &mdash; in all directions &mdash; by all modes of approach &mdash; in all relations and through all
              conditions &mdash; they struggle <i>back</i> to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally <i>One</i>? </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Some person may here demand: &mdash; &ldquo;Why &mdash; since it is to the <i>One</i> that the atoms struggle back
              &mdash; do we not find and define Attraction as merely &lsquo;a general tendency to a centre?&rsquo; <a name="pg0044">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;44:]</span> &mdash; why, in especial, do not <i>your</i> atoms &mdash; the atoms which you describe as having
              been radiated from a centre &mdash; proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I reply that <i>they do;</i> as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of
              the centre <i>as such</i>. They all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphericity with which they have been radiated
              into space. Each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course,
              than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled &mdash; but is <i>not</i> thus impelled because the centre is <i>the
                point of its origin</i>. It is not to any <i>point</i> that the atoms are allied. It is not any <i>locality</i>, either in the
              concrete or in the abstract, to which I suppose them bound. Nothing like <i>location</i> was conceived as their origin. Their source
              lies in the principle, <i>Unity</i>. <i>This</i> is their lost parent. <i>This</i> they seek always &mdash; immediately &mdash; in all
              directions &mdash; wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the
              way to its absolute satisfaction in the end. It follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the
                <i>law</i>, or <i>modus operandi</i>, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular: &mdash; that is to
              say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their <i>general centre of radiation</i> with forces inversely
              proportional with the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency,
              according to the same law, of these atoms each to each: &mdash; <i>for</i> the tendency to the <a name="pg0045">&shy;</a><span
                class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;45:]</span> centre <i>is</i> merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such.
              &mdash; Thus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no <i>necessity</i> of modification in the
              terms of the Newtonian definition of Gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this
              merely; but (always under the supposition that what I propose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might
              occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science, were a more ample phraseology adopted: &mdash; for instance: &mdash;
              &ldquo;Each atom tends to every other atom &amp;c. with a force &amp;c.: <i>the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar
                force, to a general centre</i>.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process
                <i>Intuition</i> was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal. In commencing the former journey I could only say that, with an
              irresistable Intuition, I <i>felt</i> Simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of God: &mdash; in ending the
              latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible Intuition, I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed ph&aelig;nomena
              of the Newtonian Gravity. Thus, according to the schools, I <i>prove</i> nothing. So be it: &mdash; I design but to suggest &mdash; and
              to <i>convince</i> through the suggestion. I am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously discriminative
              intellects which cannot <i>help</i> being abundantly content with my &mdash; suggestions. To these intellects &mdash; as to my own
              &mdash; there is no mathematical demonstration which <i>could</i> bring the least additional <i>true proof</i> of the great <i>Truth</i>
              which I have advanced <a name="pg0046">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;46:]</span> &mdash; <i>the truth of Original Unity as the
                source &mdash; as the principle of the Universal Ph&aelig;nomena</i>. For my part, I am not sure that I speak and see &mdash; I am not
              so sure that my heart beats and that my soul lives: &mdash; of the rising of to-morrow&rsquo;s sun &mdash; a probability that as yet
              lies in the Future &mdash; I do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure &mdash; as I am of the irretrievably by-gone <i>Fact</i>
              that All Things and All Thoughts of Things, with all their ineffable Multiplicity of Relation, sprang at once into being from the
              primordial and irrelative <i>One</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Referring to the Newtonian Gravity, Dr. Nichol, the eloquent author of &ldquo;The Architecture of the Heavens,&rdquo;
              says: &mdash; &ldquo;In truth we have no reason to suppose this great Law, as now revealed, to be the ultimate or simplest, and
              therefore the universal and all-comprehensive, form of a great Ordinance. The mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element of
              distance, has not the aspect of an ultimate <i>principle;</i> which always assumes the simplicity and self-evidence of those axioms
              which constitute the basis of Geometry.&rdquo; </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, it is quite true that &ldquo;ultimate principles,&rdquo; in the common understanding of the words, always assume
              the simplicity of geometrical axioms &mdash; (as for &ldquo;self-evidence,&rdquo; there is no such thing) &mdash; but these principles
              are clearly <i>not</i> &ldquo;ultimate;&rdquo; in other terms what we are in the habit of calling principles are no principles, properly
              speaking &mdash; since there can be but one <i>principle</i>, the Volition of God. We have no right to assume, then, from what we
              observe in rules that we choose foolishly to name &ldquo;principles,&rdquo; anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a
              principle <a name="pg0047">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;47:]</span> proper. The &ldquo;ultimate principles&rdquo; of which
              Dr. Nichol speaks as having geometrical simplicity, may and do have this geometrical turn, as being part and parcel of a vast
              geometrical system, and thus a system of simplicity itself &mdash; in which, nevertheless, the <i>truly</i> ultimate principle is, <i>as
                we know</i>, the consummation of the complex &mdash; that is to say, of the unintelligible &mdash; for is it not the Spiritual
              Capacity of God? </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I quoted Dr. Nichol&rsquo;s remark, however, not so much to question its philosophy, as by way of calling attention to
              the fact that while all men have admitted <i>some</i> principle as existing behind the Law of Gravity, no attempt has been yet made to
              point out what this principle in particular <i>is:</i> &mdash; if we except, perhaps, occasional fantastic efforts at referring it to
              Magnetism, or Mesmerism, or Swedenborgianism, or Transcendentalism, or some other equally delicious <i>ism</i> of the same species, and
              invariably patronized by one and the same species of people. The great mind of Newton, while boldly grasping the Law itself, shrank from
              the principle of the Law. The more fluent and comprehensive at least, if not the more patient and profound, sagacity of Laplace, had not
              the courage to attack it. But hesitation on the part of these two astronomers it is, perhaps, not so very difficult to understand. They,
              as well as all the first class of mathematicians, were mathematicians <i>solely:</i> &mdash; their intellect, at least, had a
              firmly-pronounced mathematico-physical tone. What lay not distinctly within the domain of Physics, or of Mathematics, seemed to them
              either Non-Entity or Shadow. Nevertheless, we may well wonder that Leibnitz, who was a marked exception to the <a name="pg0048"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;48:]</span> general rule in these respects, and whose mental temperament was a singular
              admixture of the mathematical with the physico-metaphysical, did not at once investigate and establish the point at issue. Either Newton
              or Laplace, seeking a principle and discovering none <i>physical</i>, would have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was
              absolutely none; but it is almost impossible to fancy, of Leibnitz, that, having exhausted in his search the physical dominions, he
              would not have stepped at once, boldly and hopefully, amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of Metaphysics. Here, indeed, it is
              clear that he <i>must</i> have adventured in search of the treasure: &mdash; that he did not find it after all, was, perhaps, because
              his fairy guide, Imagination, was not sufficiently well-grown, or well-educated, to direct him aright. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> I observed, just now, that, in fact, there had been certain vague attempts at referring Gravity to some very uncertain
                <i>isms</i>. These attempts, however, although considered bold and justly so considered, looked no farther than to the generality
              &mdash; the merest generality &mdash; of the Newtonian Law. Its <i>modus operandi</i> has never, to my knowledge, been approached in the
              way of an effort at explanation. It is, therefore, with no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset, and before I can
              bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent to decide on them, that I here declare the <i>modus
                operandi</i> of the Law of Gravity to be an exceedingly simple and perfectly explicable thing &mdash; that is to say, when we make our
              advances towards it in just gradations and in the true direction &mdash; when we regard it from the proper point of view. <a
                name="pg0049">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;49:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Whether we reach the idea of absolute <i>Unity</i> as the source of All Things, from a consideration of Simplicity as
              the most probable characteristic of the original action of God; &mdash; whether we arrive at it from an inspection of the universality
              of relation in the gravitating ph&aelig;nomena; &mdash; or whether we attain it as a result of the mutual corroboration afforded by both
              processes; &mdash; still, the idea itself, if entertained at all, is entertained in inseparable connection with another idea &mdash;
              that of the condition of the Universe of Stars as we <i>now</i> perceive it &mdash; that is to say, a condition of immeasurable
                <i>diffusion</i> through space. Now a connection between these two ideas &mdash; unity and diffusion &mdash; cannot be established
              unless through the entertainment of a third idea &mdash; that of <i>radiation</i>. Absolute Unity being taken as a centre, then the
              existing Universe of Stars is the result of <i>radiation</i> from that centre. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, the laws of radiation are <i>known</i>. They are part and parcel of the <i>sphere</i>. They belong to the class of
              indisputable geometrical properties. We say of them, &ldquo;they are true &mdash; they are evident.&rdquo; To demand <i>why</i> they are
              true, would be to demand why the axioms are true upon which their demonstration is based. Nothing is demonstrable, strictly speaking;
              but if anything <i>be</i>, then the properties &mdash; the laws in question are demonstrated. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But these laws &mdash; what do they declare? Radiation &mdash; how &mdash; by what steps does it proceed outwardly from
              a centre? </p>
            <p class="flind4"> From a <i>luminous</i> centre, <i>Light</i> issues by radiation; and the quantities of light received upon any given
              plane, supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer <a name="pg0050">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;50:]</span>
              the centre and now farther from it, will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the
              lumimous body, are increased; and will be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The expression of the law may be thus generalized: &mdash; the number of light-particles (or, if the phrase be
              preferred, the number of light-impressions) received upon the shifting plane, will be <i>inversely</i> proportional with the squares of
              the distances of the plane. Generalizing yet again, we may say that the diffusion &mdash; the scattering &mdash; the radiation, in a
              word &mdash; is <i>directly</i> proportional with the squares of the distances. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> For example: at the distance B, from the luminous centre A, a certain number of particles are so diffused as to occupy
              the surface B. Then at double the distance &mdash; that is to say </p>
            <div style="width: 470px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
              <div style="width: 330px;">
                <p>
                  <img alt="Eureka figure 1" src="../../images/eurekaf1.gif" style="height: 125; width: 300;" />
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p> at C &mdash; they will be so much farther diffused as to occupy four such surfaces: &mdash; at treble the distance, or at D, they will
              be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such surfaces: &mdash; while, at quadruple the distance, or at E, they <a name="pg0051"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;51:]</span> will have become so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such surfaces
              &mdash; and so on forever. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In saying, generally, that the radiation proceeds in direct proportion with the squares of the distances, we use the
              term radiation to express <i>the degree of the diffusion</i> as we proceed outwardly from the centre. Conversing the idea, and employing
              the word &ldquo;concentralization&rdquo; to express <i>the degree of the drawing together</i> as we come back toward the centre from an
              outward position, we may say that concentralization proceeds <i>inversely</i> as the squares of the distances. In other words, we have
              reached the conclusion that, on the hypothesis that matter was originally radiated from a centre and is now returning to it, the
              concentralization, in the return, proceeds <i>exactly as we know the force of gravitation to proceed</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now here, if we could be permitted to assume that concentralization exactly represents the <i>force of the tendency to
                the centre</i> &mdash; that the one is exactly proportional with the other, and that the two proceed together &mdash; we should have
              shown all that is required. The sole difficulty existing, then, is to establish a direct proportion between
              &ldquo;concentralization&rdquo; and the <i>force</i> of concentralization; and this is done, of course, if we establish such proportion
              between &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; and the <i>force</i> of radiation. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> A very slight inspection of the Heavens assures us that the stars have a certain general uniformity, equability, or
              equidistance, of distribution through that region of space in which, collectively, and in a roughly globular form, they are situated:
              &mdash; this species of very general, rather than absolute, equability, being in full keeping with my deduction <a name="pg0052"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;52:]</span> of inequidistance, within certain limits, among the originally diffused atoms, as
              a corollary from the design of infinite complexity of relation out of irrelation. I started, it will be remembered, with the idea of a
              generally uniform but particularly <i>un</i>uniform distribution of the atoms; &mdash; an idea, I repeat, which an inspection of the
              stars, as they exist, confirms. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> But even in the merely general equability of distribution, as regards the atoms, there appears a difficulty which, no
              doubt, has already suggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that I suppose this equability of distribution
              effected through <i>radiation from a centre</i>. The very first glance at the idea, radiation, forces us to the entertainment of the
              hitherto unseparated and seemingly inseparable idea of agglomeration about a centre, with dispersion as we recede from it &mdash; the
              idea, in a word, of <i>in</i>equability of distribution in respect to the matter radiated. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now, I have elsewhere<a name="tf05201" href="#fn05201">*</a> observed that it is by just such difficulties as the one
              now in question &mdash; such peculiarities &mdash; such roughness &mdash; such protuberances above the plane of the ordinary &mdash;
              that Reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the True. By the difficulty &mdash; the &ldquo;peculiarity&rdquo; &mdash; now
              presented, I leap at once to <i>the</i> secret &mdash; a secret which I might never have attained <i>but</i> for the peculiarity and the
              inferences which, <i>in its mere character of peculiarity</i>, it affords me. </p>
