                <p> This volume was issued about July 11, 1848. (Arrangements for publication had been made with Putnam by May 23, 1848, when Poe
                  signed a promissory <a href="../docs/p4805230.htm">note</a> for a loan, to be repaid from the proceeds of <i>Eureka</i>.) The
                  earliest reviews appear in the <i>Morning Express</i> (New York) and the <i>Commercial Advertiser</i> (New York) of July 12, 1848.
                  The copy provided to the Clerk&rsquo;s Office for copyright was deposited on July 31, 1848. </p>
                <p>
                  <b>
                    <i>Eureka: A Prose Poem</i>
                  </b> (1848) </p>

                </ul>
                <p> The number of copies printed is uncertain. Although Poe dearly wanted an edition of 50,000 copies, apparently only 500 were
                  printed. The suggestion is made on occasion that in this work, Poe is being satirical or hoaxing, but the evidence strongly shows
                  that Poe took his essay on cosmology very seriously indeed (aside from the intentionally humorous material in the first section). In
                  a <a href="../letters/p4907070.htm">letter</a> of July 7, 1849 to Mrs. Clemm, Poe wrote: &ldquo;I have no desire to live since I
                  have done &lsquo;Eureka.&rsquo; I could accomplish nothing more.&rdquo; </p>

                    hand</a>.) The list of prior owners is as follows: <b>1.</b> Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849); <b>2.</b> Rufus Wilmot Griswold
                  (1815-1857), New York editor and Poe&rsquo;s literary executor (presumably sent to Griswold by Poe&rsquo;s aunt, Maria Clemm)
                    <b>3.</b> George Henry Moore (1823-1892) (as executor of Griswold&rsquo;s estate) (In the a column of &ldquo;Literariana&rdquo; in
                    <i>Roundtable</i>, June 4, 1864 appears a comment on this copy as &ldquo;a curious relic of Poe in our possession,&rdquo; quoting
                  two of the longer notes added by Poe in manuscript. The person who wrote this is not known, although it might be Charles H.
                  Sweetser, who was one of the editors) <b>4.</b> William Evarts Benjamin (1859-1940) (noted by Stedman and Woodberry in their general
                  preface, dated October 1894, as then &ldquo;being on the shelves&rdquo; of Wm. E. Benjamin, a younger son of Park Benjamin
                  (1809-1864), who had actually known Poe); <b>5.</b> George T. Maxwell, New York collector (sold at Libbie and Co. in Boston on April
                  23, 1895, item 434, for $69); <b>6.</b> John Fletcher Hurst (1834-1903), Madison, New Jersey, president of Drew Theological Seminary
                  (sold March 20, 1905 for $530); <b>7.</b> Stephen H. Wakeman; <b>8.</b> A. W. S. Rosenbach; <b>9.</b> Mrs. Florence Meyer Blumenthal
                  (1875-1930) of Paris; <b>10.</b> Gabriel Wells, New York bookseller, (purchased in March or April 1933 along with the
                  Blumenthal&rsquo;s entire collection, paying $50,000 for all items); <b>11.</b> H. Bradley Martin (Martin purchased the entire
                  collection of Poe material offered by Wells about 1940) (the H. B. Martin collection was sold January 30-31, 1990 at Sotheby auction
                  in New York), where this copy was item 2212); <b>12.</b> Stephen Lowentheil, 19th Century Shop, Baltimore; <b>13.</b> Susan Jaffe
                  Tane (purchased about 1993 for $120,000) (A beautiful and remarkably faithful facsimile of this copy was made in 1928 in Paris, in
                  an edition of 50 copies. It is occasionally mistaken for the original. Indeed, the edition of <i>Eureka</i> edited by Stuart and
                  Susan F. Levine, 2004, misleadingly lists the original as being in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, where they may have
                  examined one of the facsimiles instead of the original. Alternatively, they may have been able to see the original in the mid 1980s,
                  while H. Bradley Martin kept some of his Poe materials on deposit at the Pierpont Morgan Library. Because publication of their
                    <i>Eureka</i> was unexpectedly delayed for more than a decade, Martin had died and his collection had been sold at auction many
                  years before the imprint date, which may explain why his name is not mentioned in the acknowledgments.) (The Sotheby catalog of 1990
                  perpetuates a bibliographical error concerning this copy. Following information originally published by Heartman and Canny in 1943,
                  the name of Price is added to the list of owners, which the Sotheby cataloger suggests as possibly being Peirce. While there was an
                  annotated copy of <i>Eureka</i> in the Peirce sale of 1903, it was actually in the part of that sale of material from the collection
                  of William Nelson, and is the copy now at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.) </li>

                  A. Poe.&rdquo; The list of prior owners is as follows: <b>1.</b> Sarah Helen Whitman; <b>2.</b> Miss Charlotte F. Dailey and Mrs.
                  Henry R. Chace, Providence, RI (inherited from Mrs. Whitman); <b>3.</b> Max Harzof, New York bookdealer (purchased from Miss Dailey
                  and Mrs. Chace in 1930 for $20,000. Harzof offered the collection about August of 1930 to Owen D. Young for $65,000, but Young
                  declined due to the effect of the Depression on his finances); <b>4.</b> J. K. Lilly (Shipped to Lilly on September 10, 1930 for
                  $50,000, paid in four installments, making the final payment on December 1, 1930); <b>5.</b> Lilly Library (donated by Lilly in

                  letters. The book sold at another Nelson auction, Nov. 22, 1915, item 1000, for $32.50); David Gage Joyce (1885-1937) of Chicago, IL
