            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The radical assumptions of this Discourse suggest to me, and in fact imply, certain important <i>modifications</i> of
              the Nebular Theory as given by Laplace. The efforts of the repulsive power I have considered as made for the purpose of preventing
              contact among the atoms, and thus as made in the ratio of the approach to contact &mdash; that is to say, in the ratio of
                condensation.<a href="#fn08101">*</a> In other words, <i>Electricity</i>, with its involute ph&aelig;nomena, heat, light and
              magnetism, is to be understood as proceeding as condensation proceeds, and, of course, inversely as density proceeds, <a name="pg0082"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;82:]</span> or the <i>cessation to condense</i>. Thus the Sun, in the process of its
              aggregation, must soon, in developing repulsion, have become excessively heated &mdash; perhaps incandescent: and we can perceive how
              the operation of discarding its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation [[encrustation]] of its surface
              consequent on cooling. Any common experiment shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested, is separated, through
              heterogeneity, from the interior mass. But, on every successive rejection of the crust, the new surface would appear incandescent as
              before; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted as to be readily loosened and discharged, may well be imagined as
              exactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed, by the whole mass, to restore the equilibrium of its two forces,
              disarranged through condensation. In other words: &mdash; by the time the electric influence (Repulsion) has prepared the surface for
              rejection, we are to understand that the gravitating influence (Attraction) is precisely ready to reject it. Here, then, as everywhere,
                <i>the Body and the Soul walk hand in hand</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> These ideas are empirically confirmed at all points. Since condensation can never, in any body, be considered as
              absolutely at an end, we are warranted in anticipating that, whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter, we shall find
              indications of resident luminosity in <i>all</i> the stellar bodies &mdash; moons and planets as well as suns. That our Moon is strongly
              self-luminous, we see at her every total eclipse, when, if not so, she would disappear. On the dark part of the satellite, too, during
              her phases, we often observe flashes like our own Auroras; and that these latter, with our various other so-called electrical
              ph&aelig;nomena, <a name="pg0083">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;83:]</span> without reference to any more steady radiance,
              must give our Earth a certain appearance of luminosity to an inhabitant of the Moon, is quite evident. In fact, we should regard all the
              ph&aelig;nomena referred to, as mere manifestations, in different moods and degrees, of the Earth&rsquo;s feebly-continued condensation. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> If my views are tenable, we should be prepared to find the newer planets &mdash; that is to say, those nearer the Sun
              &mdash; more luminous than those older and more remote: &mdash; and the extreme brilliancy of Venus (on whose dark portions, during her
              phases, the Auroras are frequently visible) does not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to the central orb. She
              is no doubt vividly self-luminous, although less so than Mercury: while the luminosity of Neptune may be comparatively nothing. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Admitting what I have urged, it is clear that, from the moment of the Sun&rsquo;s discarding a ring, there must be a
              continuous diminution both of his heat and light, on account of the continuous encrustation of his surface; and that a period would
              arrive &mdash; the period immediately previous to a new discharge &mdash; when a <i>very material</i> decrease of both light and heat,
              must become apparent. Now, we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable. On the Melville islands &mdash; to adduce
              merely one out of a hundred examples &mdash; we find traces of <i>ultra-tropical</i> vegetation &mdash; of plants that never could have
              flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our Sun to any portion of the surface of the Earth. Is
              such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the whirling-off of Venus? At this epoch must <a name="pg0084"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;84:]</span> have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence; and, in fact, this
              influence must then have attained its maximum: &mdash; leaving out of view, of course, the period when the Earth itself was discarded
              &mdash; the period of its mere organization. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Again: &mdash; we know that there exist <i>non-luminous suns</i> &mdash; that is to say, suns whose existence we
              determine through the movements of others, but whose luminosity is not sufficient to impress us. Are these suns invisible merely on
              account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of a planet? And yet again: &mdash; may we not &mdash; at least in certain
              cases &mdash; account for the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously suspected, by the hypothesis that, having rolled
              with encrusted surfaces throughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history, each of these suns, in whirling off a new
              secondary, has at length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent interior? &mdash; To the well-ascertained fact of
              the proportional increase of heat as we descend into the Earth, I need of course, do nothing more than refer: &mdash; it comes in the
              strongest possible corroboration of all that I have said on the topic now at issue. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> In speaking, not long ago, of the repulsive or electrical influence, I remarked that &ldquo;the important
              ph&aelig;nomena of vitality, consciousness, and thought, whether we observe them generally or in detail, seem to proceed <i>at least in
                the ratio of the heterogeneous</i>.&rdquo;<a href="#fn08401">*</a> I mentioned, too, that I would recur to the suggestion: &mdash; and
              this is the proper point at which to do so. Looking at the matter, first, in detail, we <a name="pg0085">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;85:]</span> perceive that not merely the <i>manifestation</i> of vitality, but its importance, consequence, and elevation
              of character, keep pace, very closely, with the heterogeneity, or complexity, of the animal structure. Looking at the question, now, in
              its generality, and referring to the first movements of the atoms towards mass-constitution, we find that heterogeneousness, brought
              about directly through condensation, is proportional with it forever. We thus reach the proposition that <i>the importance of the
                development of the terrestrial vitality proceeds as the terrestrial condensation</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Now this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of animals on the Earth. As it has proceeded in
              its condensation, superior and still superior races have appeared. Is it impossible that the successive geological revolutions which
              have attended, at least, if not immediately caused, these successive elevations of vitalic character &mdash; is it improbable that these
              revolutions have themselves been produced by the successive planetary discharges from the Sun &mdash; in other words, by the successive
              variations in the solar influence on the Earth? Were this idea tenable, we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the discharge of
              yet a new planet, interior to Mercury, may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial surface &mdash; a modification from
              which may spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to Man. These thoughts impress me with all the force of truth &mdash;
              but I throw them out, of course, merely in their obvious character of suggestion. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> The Nebular Theory of Laplace has lately received far <a name="pg0086">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"
                >[page&nbsp;86:]</span> more confirmation than it needed, at the hands of the philosopher, Compte [[Comte]]. These two have thus
              together shown &mdash; <i>not</i>, to be sure, that Matter at any period actually existed as described, in a state of nebular diffusion,
              but that, admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much beyond the space now occupied by our solar system, <i>and to
                have commenced a movement towards a centre</i> &mdash; it must gradually have assumed the various forms and motions which are now
              seen, in that system, to obtain. A demonstration such as this &mdash; a dynamical and mathematical demonstration, as far as
              demonstration can be &mdash; unquestionable and unquestioned &mdash; unless, indeed, by that unprofitable and disreputable tribe, the
              professional questioners &mdash; the mere madmen who deny the Newtonian law of Gravity on which the results of the French mathematicians
              are based &mdash; a demonstration, I say, such as this, would to most intellects be conclusive &mdash; and I confess that it is so to
              mine &mdash; of the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> That the demonstration does not <i>prove</i> the hypothesis, according to the common understanding of the word
              &ldquo;proof,&rdquo; I admit, of course. To show that certain existing results &mdash; that certain established facts &mdash; may be,
              even mathematically, accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis, is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself. In
              other words: &mdash; to show that, certain data being given, a certain existing result might, or even <i>must</i>, have ensued, will
              fail to prove that this result <i>did</i> ensue, <i>from the data</i>, until such time as it shall be also shown that there are, <i>and
                can be</i>, no other data from which the result in question <a name="pg0087">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;87:]</span> might
                <i>equally</i> have ensued. But, in the case now discussed, although all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of
              terming &ldquo;proof,&rdquo; still there are many intellects, and those of the loftiest order, to which <i>no</i> proof could bring one
              iota of additional <i>conviction</i>. Without going into details which might impinge upon the Cloud-Land of Metaphysics, I may as well
              here observe that the force of conviction, in cases such as this, will always, with the right-thinking, be proportional to the amount of
                <i>complexity</i> intervening between the hypothesis and the result. To be less abstract: &mdash; The greatness of the complexity
              found existing among cosmical conditions, by rendering great in the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these
              conditions <i>at once</i>, strengthens, also in the same proportion, our faith in that hypothesis which does, in such manner,
              satisfactorily account for them: &mdash; and as <i>no</i> complexity can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical
              conditions, so no conviction can be stronger &mdash; to <i>my</i> mind at least &mdash; than that with which I am impressed by an
              hypothesis that not only reconciles these conditions, with mathematical accuracy, and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible
              whole, but is, at the same time, the <i>sole</i> hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has been ever enabled to account for
              them <i>at all</i>. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> A most unfounded opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and even in scientific circles &mdash; the opinion
              that the so-called Nebular Cosmogony has been overthrown. This fancy has arisen from the report of late observations made, among what
              hitherto have been termed the &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; through the large telescope of Cincinnati, and the world-renowned <a
                name="pg0088">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;88:]</span> instrument of Lord Rosse. Certain spots in the firmament which
              presented, even to the most powerful of the old telescopes, the appearance of nebulosity, or haze, had been regarded for a long time as
              confirming the theory of Laplace. They were looked upon as stars in that very process of condensation which I have been attempting to
              describe. Thus it was supposed that we &ldquo;had ocular evidence&rdquo; &mdash; an evidence, by the way, which has always been found
              very questionable &mdash; of the truth of the hypothesis; and, although certain telescopic improvements, every now and then, enabled us
              to perceive that a spot, here and there, which we had been classing among the nebul&aelig;, was, in fact, but a cluster of stars
              deriving its nebular character only from its immensity of distance &mdash; still it was thought that no doubt could exist as to the
              actual nebulosity of numerous other masses, the strong-holds of the nebulists, bidding defiance to every effort at segregation. Of these
              latter the most interesting was the great &ldquo;nebula&rdquo; in the constellation Orion: &mdash; but this, with innumerable other
              miscalled &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; when viewed through the magnificent modern telescopes, has become resolved into a simple
              collection of stars. Now this fact has been very generally understood as conclusive against the Nebular Hypothesis of Laplace; and, on
              announcement of the discoveries in question, the most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent popularizer of the theory, Dr. Nichol,
              went so far as to &ldquo;admit the necessity of abandoning&rdquo; an idea which had formed the material of his most praiseworthy book.<a
                href="#fn08801">*</a>
              <a name="pg0089">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;89:]</span>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Many of my readers will no doubt be inclined to say that the result of these new investigations <i>has</i> at least a
              strong <i>tendency</i> to overthrow the hypothesis; while some of them, more thoughtful, will suggest that, although the theory is by no
              means disproved through the segregation of the particular &ldquo;nebul&aelig;&rdquo; alluded to, still a <i>failure</i> to segregate
              them, with such telescopes, might well have been understood as a triumphant <i>corroboration</i> of the theory: &mdash; and this latter
              class will be surprised, perhaps, to hear me say that even with <i>them</i> I disagree. If the propositions of this Discourse have been
              comprehended, it will be seen that, in my view, a failure to segregate the &ldquo;nebul&aelig;&rdquo; would have tended to the
              refutation, rather than to the confirmation, of the Nebular Hypothesis. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let me explain: &mdash; The Newtonian Law of Gravity we may, of course, assume as demonstrated. This law, it will be
              remembered, I have referred to the r&euml;action of the first Divine Act &mdash; to the r&euml;action of an exercise of the Divine
              Volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty. This difficulty is that of forcing the normal into the abnormal &mdash; of impelling that
              whose originality, and therefore whose rightful condition, was <i>One</i>, to take upon itself the wrongful condition of <i>Many</i>. It
              is only by conceiving this difficulty as <i>temporarily</i> overcome, that we can comprehend a r&euml;action. <a name="pg0090"
                >&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;90:]</span> There could have been no r&euml;action had the act been infinitely continued. So
              long as the act <i>lasted</i>, no r&euml;action, of course, could commence; in other words, no <i>gravitation</i> could take place
              &mdash; for we have considered the one as but the manifestation of the other. But gravitation <i>has</i> taken place; therefore the act
              of Creation has ceased: and gravitation has long ago taken place; therefore the act of Creation has long ago ceased. We can no more
              expect, then, to observe the <i>primary processes</i> of Creation; and to these primary processes the condition of nebulosity has
              already been explained to belong. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Through what we know of the propagation of light, we have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have existed,
              under the forms in which we now see them, for an inconceivable number of years. So far back <i>at least</i>, then, as the period when
              these stars underwent condensation, must have been the epoch at which the mass-constitutive processes began. That we may conceive these
              processes, then, as still going on in the case of certain &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; while in all other cases we find them thoroughly
              at an end, we are forced into assumptions for which we have really <i>no</i> basis whatever &mdash; we have to thrust in, again, upon
              the revolting Reason, the blasphemous idea of special interposition &mdash; we have to suppose that, in the particular instances of
              these &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; an unerring God found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary regulations &mdash; certain
              improvements of the general law &mdash; certain retouchings and emendations, in a word, which had the effect of deferring the completion
              of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond the &aelig;ra during which all the other stellar bodies had time, <a
                name="pg0091">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;91:]</span> not only to be fully constituted, but to grow hoary with an
              unspeakable old age. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Of course, it will be immediately objected that since the light by which we recognize the nebul&aelig; now, must be
              merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years ago, the processes at present observed, or supposed to be observed, are, in
              fact, <i>not</i> processes now actually going on, but the phantoms of processes completed long in the Past &mdash; just as I maintain
              all these mass-constitutive processes <i>must</i> have been. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> To this I reply that neither is the now-observed condition of the condensed stars their actual condition, but a
              condition completed long in the Past; so that my argument drawn from the <i>relative</i> condition of the stars and the
              &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; is in no manner disturbed. Moreover, those who maintain the existence of nebul&aelig;, do <i>not</i> refer
              the nebulosity to extreme distance; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective nebulosity. That we may conceive, indeed, a
              nebular mass as visible at all, we must conceive it as <i>very near us</i> in comparison with the condensed stars brought into view by
              the modern telescopes. In maintaining the appearances in question, then, to be really nebulous, we maintain their comparative vicinity
              to our point of view. Thus, their condition, as we see them now, must be referred to an epoch <i>far less remote</i> than that to which
              we may refer the now-observed condition of at least the majority of the stars. &mdash; In a word, should Astronomy ever demonstrate a
              &ldquo;nebula,&rdquo; in the sense at present intended, I should consider the Nebular Cosmogony &mdash; <i>not</i>, indeed, as
              corroborated by the demonstration &mdash; but as thereby irretrievably overthrown. <a name="pg0092">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc"

            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> By way, however, of rendering unto C&aelig;sar <i>no more</i> than the things that are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, let me here
              remark that the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious a result, seems to have been suggested to Laplace in great
              measure by a misconception &mdash; by the very misconception of which we have just been speaking &mdash; by the generally prevalent
              misunderstanding of the character of the nebul&aelig;, so mis-named. These he supposed to be, in reality, what their designation
              implies. The fact is, this great man had, very properly, an inferior faith in his own merely <i>perceptive</i> powers. In respect,
              therefore, to the actual existence of nebul&aelig; &mdash; an existence so confidently maintained by his telescopic contemporaries
              &mdash; he depended less upon what he saw than upon what he heard. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> It will be seen that the only valid objections to his theory, are those made to its hypothesis <i>as</i> such &mdash;
              to what suggested it &mdash; not to what it suggests; to its propositions rather than to its results. His most unwarranted assumption
              was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a centre, in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms, in unlimited
              succession, extended throughout the Universal space. I have already shown that, under such circumstances, there could have occurred no
              movement at all; and Laplace, consequently, assumed one on no more philosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary
              for the establishment of what he intended to establish. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> His original idea seems to have been a compound of the true Epicurean atoms with the false nebul&aelig; of his
              contemporaries; and thus his theory presents us with the singular <a name="pg0093">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;93:]</span>
              anomaly of absolute truth deduced, as a mathematical result, from a hybrid datum of ancient imagination intertangled with modern
              inacumen. Laplace&rsquo;s real strength lay, in fact, in an almost miraculous mathematical instinct: &mdash; on this he relied; and in
              no instance did it fail or deceive him: &mdash; in the case of the Nebular Cosmogony, it led him, blindfolded, through a labyrinth of
              Error, into one of the most luminous and stupendous temples of Truth. </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Let us now fancy, for the moment, that the ring first thrown off by the Sun &mdash; that is to say, the ring whose
              breaking-up constituted Neptune &mdash; did not, in fact, break up until the throwing-off of the ring out of which Uranus arose; that
              this latter ring, again, remained perfect until the discharge of that out of which sprang Saturn; that this latter, again, remained
              entire until the discharge of that from which originated Jupiter &mdash; and so on. Let us imagine, in a word, that no dissolution
              occurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave birth to Mercury. We thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of
              c&ouml;existent concentric circles; and looking as well at <i>them</i> as at the processes by which, according to Laplace&rsquo;s
              hypothesis, they were constructed, we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of the original
              irradiation as I have described it. Is it impossible that, on measuring the <i>forces</i>, respectively, by which each successive
              planetary circle was thrown off &mdash; that is to say, on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which
              occasioned the successive discharges &mdash; we should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed? <i>Is it improbable that
                we should discover these</i>
              <a name="pg0094">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;94:]</span>
              <i>forces to have varied &mdash; as in the original radiation</i> &mdash; <i>proportionally with the squares of the distances?</i>
            </p>
            <p class="flind4"> Our solar system, consisting, in chief, of one sun, with seventeen planets certainly, and possibly a few more,
              revolving about it at various distances, and attended by seventeen moons assuredly, but <i>very</i> probably by several others &mdash;
              is now to be considered as <i>an example</i> of the innumerable agglomerations which proceeded to take place throughout the Universal
              Sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the Divine Volition. I mean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a <i>generic
                instance</i> of these agglomerations, or, more correctly, of the ulterior conditions at which they arrived. If we keep our attention
              fixed on the idea of <i>the utmost possible Relation</i> as the Omnipotent design, and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through
              difference of form, among the original atoms, and particular inequidistance, we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that
              even any two of the incipient agglomerations reached precisely the same result in the end. We shall rather be inclined to think that
                <i>no two</i> stellar bodies in the Universe &mdash; whether suns, planets or moons &mdash; are particularly, while <i>all</i> are
              generally, similar. Still less, then, can we imagine any two <i>assemblages</i> of such bodies &mdash; any two &ldquo;systems&rdquo;
              &mdash; as having more than a general resemblance.<a href="#fn09401">*</a> Our telescopes, at this point, thoroughly confirm our
              deduction. <a name="pg0095">&shy;</a><span class="pgloc">[page&nbsp;95:]</span> Taking our own solar system, then, as merely a loose or
              general type of all, we have so far proceeded in our subject as to survey the Universe under the aspect of a spherical space, throughout
              which, dispersed with merely general equability, exist a number of but generally similar <i>systems</i>. </p>

                <p> in the left margin, by the phrase &ldquo;total eclipse&rdquo; in the paragraph beginning &ldquo;These ideas are empirically
                  confirmed . . .&rdquo; on page 82, a question mark has been drawn in pencil. It is uncertain whether or not this mark was made by
                  Poe, or what it was intended to indiate. </p>
                <p> In three of the copies bearing his own annotations (the Osborne, Nelson-Mabbott, and Hurst-Wakeman copies), Poe corrects the
                  reference in the footnote on page 84 from page 36 to page 37. In the same three copies, he changed &ldquo;nebul&aelig;,&rdquo; on
                  page 88, to &ldquo;nebula.&rdquo; Why he did not make the same correction in the copy he gave to Mrs. Whitman is a minor mystery. </p>
